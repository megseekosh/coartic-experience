However, natural infant-directed speech shows large degrees of phonetic variability, and the resulting overlap between categories suggests that category learning based on distributional clustering may not be feasible without constraints on the learning process, or exploitation of other sources of information. The present study examines whether mothers' prosodic modifications within infantdirected speech help the distributional learning of vowel categories. Specifically, we hypothesize that `motherese' provides the infant with a subset of high-quality learning tokens that improve category learning. In an analysis of vowel tokens taken from natural mother-infant interactions, we found that prosody can be used to distinguish high-quality tokens (with expanded formant frequencies) from low-quality tokens in the input. Moreover, in simulations of distributional learning we found that models trained on this small set of high-quality tokens provide better classification than models trained on the complete set of tokens. Taken together, these findings show that distributional learning of vowel categories can be improved by attributing importance to tokens that are prosodically prominent in the input. The prosodic properties of motherese might thus be a helpful cue for infants in supporting phonetic category learning.},

After empirically accounting for the altered vowel positions, they reported small but consistent increases in F2 transition onsets in emphatically produced CVs that could not be attributed to vowel context influences, and that differed across stop place. At issue is whether the findings of these authors can be replicated, but in the opposite direction, for CVs produced at fast speaking rates. A modified locus equation regression metric was similarly used to account for rate-induced vowel reduction effects in predicting frequencies of F2 transition onsets in rapid speech. Six American-English speakers produced [V1.CV2] sequences embedded in a carrier sentence, at three speaking tempos: normal, fast, and fastest. Significant differences were found between `predicted' and `observed' F2 onsets across stops, with alveolars and velars showing greater decreases in F2 onsets during more rapid speech than labials. The complementary findings are discussed relative to a unified view of anticipatory coarticulation in CV production across a continuum of hyperarticulated spectral expansion to hypoarticulated spectral reduction.},

An important function of prelinguistic vocalizing may be to elicit parental behavior in ways that facilitate the infant's own learning about speech and language. Infants use parental feedback to their babbling to learn new vocal forms, but the microstructure of parental responses to babbling has not been studied. To enable precise manipulation of the proximal infant cues that may influence maternal behavior, we used a playback paradigm to assess mothers' responsiveness to prerecorded audiovisual clips of unfamiliar infants' noncry prelinguistic vocalizations and actions. Acoustic characteristics and directedness of vocalizations were manipulated to test their efficacy in structuring social interactions. We also compared maternal responsiveness in the playback paradigm and in free play with their own infants. Maternal patterns of reactions to babbling were stable across both tasks. In the playback task, we found specific vocal cues, such as the degree of resonance and the transition timing of consonant-\-vowel syllables, predicted contingent maternal responding. Vocalizations directed at objects also facilitated increased responsiveness. The responses mothers exhibited, such as sensitive speech and vocal imitation, are known to facilitate vocal learning and development. Infants, by influencing the behavior of their caregivers with their babbling, create social interactions that facilitate their own communicative development.},

  abstract = {Objectives
The objectives of this study were to examine the quantity of adult words, adult-child conversational turns, and electronic media in the auditory environments of toddlers who are hard of hearing (HH) and to examine whether these variables contributed to variability in children's communication outcomes.

Design
Participants were 28 children with mild to severe hearing loss. Full-day recordings of children's auditory environments were collected within 6 months of their 2nd birthdays by utilizing LENA (Language ENvironment Analysis) technology. The system analyzes full-day acoustic recordings, yielding estimates of the quantity of adult words, conversational turns, and electronic media exposure in the recordings. Children's communication outcomes were assessed via the receptive and expressive scales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 2 years of age and the Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language at 3 years of age.

Results
On average, the HH toddlers were exposed to approximately 1400 adult words per hour and participated in approximately 60 conversational turns per hour. An average of 8\% of each recording was classified as electronic media. However, there was considerable within-group variability on all three measures. Frequency of conversational turns, but not adult words, was positively associated with children's communication outcomes at 2 and 3 years of age. Amount of electronic media exposure was negatively associated with 2-year-old receptive language abilities; however, regression results indicate that the relationship was fully mediated by the quantity of conversational turns.

Conclusions
HH toddlers who were engaged in more conversational turns demonstrated stronger linguistic outcomes than HH toddlers who were engaged in fewer conversational turns. The frequency of these interactions was found to be decreased in households with high rates of electronic media exposure. Optimal language-learning environments for HH toddlers include frequent linguistic interactions between parents and children. To support this goal, parents should be encouraged to reduce their children's exposure to electronic media.},

The purpose of this study was to examine (a) the role of neighborhood density (number of words that are phonologically similar to a target word) and frequency variables on the stuttering-like disfluencies of preschool children who stutter, and (b) whether these variables have an effect on the type of stuttering-like disfluency produced.

Method
A 500+ word speech sample was obtained from each participant (N = 15). Each stuttered word was randomly paired with the firstly produced word that closely matched it in grammatical class, familiarity, and number of syllables/phonemes. Frequency, neighborhood density, and neighborhood frequency values were obtained for the stuttered and fluent words from an online database.

Results
Findings revealed that stuttered words were lower in frequency and neighborhood frequency than fluent words. Words containing part-word repetitions and sound prolongations were also lower in frequency and/or neighborhood frequency than fluent words, but these frequency variables did not have an effect on single-syllable word repetitions. Neighborhood density failed to influence the susceptibility of words to stuttering, as well as the type of stuttering-like disfluency produced.

Conclusions
In general, findings suggest that neighborhood and frequency variables not only influence the fluency with which words are produced in speech, but also have an impact on the type of stuttering-like disfluency produced.},

We ask (a) if phonetic duration is affected by multi-word frequency in both elicited and spontaneous speech, and (b) if syntactic constituency modulates the effect. We show that phonetic durations are reduced in higher frequency sequences, regardless of constituency: duration is shorter for more frequent sequences within and across syntactic boundaries.

  title = {Starting Big: {{The}} Role of Multiword Phrases},
  author = {Arnon, Inbal},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Why are children better language learners than adults? Intuitively, there is a difference
between the unstructured (yet successful) way a child learns language and the effortful
and often frustrating experience of trying to master a new language as an adult. On an
empirical level, non-native speakers rarely reach native proficiency in pronunciation,
morphological and syntactic processing, or in the use of formulaic language and idioms.
How we understand these differences is related to our conception of first language
learning, and of the object of learning \textendash{} what does it mean to know language? What is it
that children or second learners have to learn?
In this dissertation, I suggest that the answer lies, at least in part, in the linguistic units
that children and adults learn from. I propose the Starting Big Hypothesis: children learn
from units that are larger and less analyzed than the ones adults learn from. Because they
do not know where word-boundaries are (or even that they exist), infants start out with a
mix of words, multi-word fragments (e.g. give-it), and short multi-word utterances (e.g. Idon't-know
or It's-my-turn), and from this early inventory extract linguistic knowledge.
This process of using larger units to learn about smaller ones can
v
argue that L2 learners make insufficient use of larger units in learning, we have to first
show that such units are an integral part of the native speaker's inventory.
I first highlight the prominence of multi-word chunks (unanalyzed units) in
children's early language use. I then show that multi-word phrases play a facilitative role
in children's production even after segmentation has taken place: for example, 4;6 yearolds
produce irregular plurals better after sentence-frames they often occur with (e.g.
Brush your \textendash{} teeth) that they do in response to questions (What are those?). These
findings show that children attend to larger units, and that such units play a role in the
process of lexical and morphological development.
Multi-word phrases, I argue, are also part of the adult inventory. In a series of studies,
I demonstrate that adult speakers are faster to process higher frequency compositional
four-word phrases like don't have to worry compared to lower frequency ones like don't
have to wait. Since the phrases were matched for part frequency (the frequency of all the
unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) and plausibility, this effect must reflect speakers'
knowledge of the frequencies of the whole-phrases. That is, on some level adult speakers
have memory traces of phrases that could otherwise have been generated. This in turn
undermines the claim that `atomic' and `derive' forms are represented in a qualitatively
different way.
Children's enhanced word production after familiar frames and adults' sensitivity to
phrase frequency both illustrate the importance of multi-word phrases in native language
learning and use. If adult difficulty in learning a second language is related to the more
segmented units they learn from, then their learning outcome should improve if they start
with larger chunks of language. I test this prediction by looking at adult learning of
grammatical gender in an artificial language. Their learning was facilitated when they
learned segmentation, semantics (the labels for objects), and grammar (which article a
noun appears with) at the same time. These findings demonstrate that (1) early units can
influence subsequent learning, and (2) there is an advantage to learning grammar from
segmenting larger units
vi
In examining the size and nature of early linguistic units, I've offered a novel perspective
on the difficulty that adults experience in learning a second language while at the same
time endorsing a usage-based and exemplar-driven approach to first language learning
where early experience plays such an important role. My focus on compositional phrases
also allowed me to contrast single-system and dual-system approaches to language and to
present evidence in support of an emergentist view of language where all linguistic
experience (be it atomic or complex) is processed by the same cognitive mechanism.
Finally, the Starting Big Hypothesis has theoretical implications for theories of L1 and L2
learning, and practical implications for the teaching of second languages.},

The app was designed and tested across three phases as mandated by the US HRSA Bridging the Word Gap Challenge. In Phase I, we developed a curriculum that promotes high-quality language interactions in Spanish and designed the app components. In Phase II, we tested the app with 20 Hispanic mothers (half high school-educated, half college-educated) in a pretest\textendash posttest design in which we examined their language interactions before and after two months of using the app. Preliminary results indicated that mother\textendash child verbal interactions increased, but not always in their native Spanish, and the difference was not statistically significant. Focus group data revealed that many of the mothers had experienced linguistic racism and that tropes surrounding Spanish-speaking identity in the USA needed to be explicitly addressed within the intervention. In Phase III, a sociolinguistic pride component was added and the app was again tested with 12 additional Hispanic mothers (all high school-educated only). This time, a statistically significant increase in mother\textendash child verbal interactions was found. Mothers also reported feeling prouder to use Spanish with their children. These results suggest that H\'ablame Beb\'e may be a viable means to reach low-income Hispanic caregivers who face obstacles in accessing health information and/or home-visiting programs for their children.},

Motion data, autonomic activity, and ``snippets'' of audio and video recordings can be conveniently logged by wearable sensors (Lazer et al., 2009). Machine learning algorithms can process these signals into meaningful markers, from child and parent behavior to outcomes such as depression or teenage drinking. Theoretically motivated aspects of daily activity can be combined and synchronized to examine reciprocal effects between children's behaviors and their environments or internal processes. Captured over longitudinal time, such data provide a new opportunity to study the processes by which individual differences emerge and stabilize. This paper introduces the reader to developments in sensing and activity recognition with implications for developmental phenomena across the lifespan, sketching a framework for leveraging mobile sensors for transactional analyses that bridge micro- and longitudinal- timescales of development. It finishes by detailing resources and best practices to facilitate the next generation of developmentalists to contribute to this emerging area.},

It focuses on measures of token-to-token variability in the production of isolated vowels and on anticipatory extrasyllabic coarticulation within V1-C-V2 sequences.

Thus far, ultrasound data have been analyzed from a subset of these participants: 6 children and 2 adults. In agreement with former studies, token-to-token variability was greater in children than in adults. Strong anticipation of V2 in V1 was found in all adults, but not in children. Most of the children showed no anticipation at all and some of them showed a small amount of anticipation along the antero-posterior dimension only, manifested in the acoustic F2 dimension.

In line with theories of optimal motor control, anticipatory coarticulation is assumed to be based on the use of internal models of the speech apparatus and its efficiency is considered to reflect the maturity of these representations.

  abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the role of motor control immaturity in the speech production characteristics of 4-year-old children, compared to adults. Specifically, two indices were examined: trial-to-trial variability, which is assumed to be linked to motor control accuracy, and anticipatory extra-syllabic vowel-to-vowel coarticulation, which is assumed to be linked to the comprehensiveness, maturity and efficiency of sensorimotor representations in the central nervous system.
Method Acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) data were recorded for 20 children and 10 adults, all native speakers of Canadian French, during the production of isolated vowels and vowelconsonant-vowel (V1-C-V2) sequences. Trial-to-trial variability was measured in isolated vowels. Extra-syllabic anticipatory coarticulation was assessed in V1-C-V2 sequences by measuring the patterns of variability of V1 associated with variations in V2. Acoustic data were reported for all subjects and articulatory data, for a subset of 6 children and 2 adults.
Results Trial-to-trial variability was significantly larger in children. Systematic and significant anticipation of V2 in V1 was always found in adults, but was rare in children. Significant anticipation was observed in children only when V1 was /a/, and only along the antero-posterior dimension, with a much smaller magnitude than in adults. A closer analysis of individual speakers revealed that some children showed adult-like anticipation along this dimension, whereas the majority did not.

For example, a Japanese child's production of the word kimono might be transcribed with an initial postalveolar affricate, as in typical velar-softening sound changes. Broad-stroke reviews of errors list striking commonalities across children acquiring different languages, whereas quantitative studies reveal enormous variability across children, some of which seems related to differences in consonant frequencies across different lexicons. This paper asks whether the appearance of commonalities across children acquiring different languages might be reconciled with the observed variability by referring to the ways in which sound change might affect frequencies in the lexicon. Correlational analyses were used to assess relationships between consonant accuracy in a database of recordings of toddlers acquiring Cantonese, English, Greek, or Japanese and two measures of consonant frequency: one specific to the lexicon being acquired, the other an average frequency calculated for the other three languages. Results showed generally positive trends, although the strength of the trends differed across measures and across languages. Many outliers in plots depicting the relationships suggested historical contingencies that have conspired to make for unexpected paths, much as in biological evolution.},

Some of this evidence suggests that knowledge is hierarchical, with generalization occurring at several different levels of abstraction away from the raw sensory input. Each familiar word-form has a distributed representation in the parametric phonetic space, which captures relevant generalizations over an individual's experience of hearing and saying specific tokens of the same word, but a parallel coarser-grained representation can be composed on the fly to process novel forms in terms of generalizations over the neighborhood of different word-forms in the individual's mental lexicon. Results of several studies of two clinical populations suggest that these different types of phonological knowledge can develop separately. Children with phonological disorder resemble younger children with typical phonological development in terms of measures of the robustness of parametric phonetic representations, whereas children with specific language impairment look like children with smaller vocabularies in terms of their processing of nonwords.},

Whereas humans generalize identity restrictions broadly, to both native and nonnative phonemes, the original model and several related variants failed to generalize to nonnative phonemes. In contrast, a revised model equipped with variables more closely matches human behavior. These findings suggest that, like syntax, phonological grammars are endowed with algebraic relations among variables that support acrossthe-board generalizations.},

  abstract = {A range of demographic variables influences how much speech young children hear. However, because studies have used vastly different sampling methods, quantitative comparison of interlocking demographic effects has been nearly impossible, across or within studies. We harnessed a unique collection of existing naturalistic, day-l\-ong recordings from 61 homes across four North American cities to examine language input as a function of age, gender, and maternal education. We analyzed adult speech heard by 3-\- to 20-\-month-o\- lds who wore audio recorders for an entire day. We annotated speaker gender and speech register (child-\-directed or adult-\-directed) for 10,861 utterances from female and male adults in these recordings. Examining age, gender, and maternal education collectively in this ecologically valid dataset, we find several key results. First, the speaker gender imbalance in the input is striking: children heard 2\textendash 3\texttimes{} more speech from females than males. Second, children in higher-\- maternal education homes heard more child-d\-irected speech than those in lower-\-maternal education homes. Finally, our analyses revealed a previously unreported effect: the proportion of child-d\- irected speech in the input increases with age, due to a decrease in adult-\-directed speech with age. This large-s\- cale analysis is an important step forward in collectively examining demographic variables that influence early development, made possible by pooled, comparable, day-\-long recordings of children's language environments. The audio recordings, annotations, and annotation software are readily available for reuse and reanalysis by other researchers.},

  abstract = {The goal of the present study was to characterize normal and disordered Brazilian Portuguese liquids. The research hypotheses were that disordered liquid sounds would be characterized by (1) longer syllable and segment durations, (2) larger and more undifferentiated displacement of the tongue and (3) that the speech errors would show sub-phonemic differences depending on the target sound. The participants of this study were 11 children with phonological disorders and 9 control participants matched for age and educational background. The children's tongue movement in the sagittal plane was recorded with ultrasound. The speech stimuli consisted of 3 repetitions of 5 words representing the four Brazilian Portuguese liquids /l/, /{$\Elztrny$}/, /{$\Elzfhr$}/ and /ʀ/ in the context of the vowel /a/. A panel of four listeners transcribed each of the productions and classified them as correct or incorrect. The outcome measures were based on duration (syllable duration, ratio L/V) and tongue displacement (percentage average displacement, anterior displacement, posterior displacement). Based on mixed model analyses of variance, the first research hypothesis was confirmed for the /l/ and /{$\Elzfhr$}/ targets, but not for the /ʀ/ and /{$\Elztrny$}/ targets. The second hypothesis was partially confirmed. The third hypothesis was confirmed. The research serves to illustrate the effects of phonological disorder on the phonetic realisation of Brazilian Portuguese liquid sounds.},

  abstract = {Language experience systematically constrains perception of speech contrasts that deviate phonologically and/or phonetically from those of the listener's native language. These effects are most dramatic in adults, but begin to emerge in infancy and undergo further development through at least early childhood. The central question addressed here is: How do nonnative speech perception findings bear on phonological and phonetic aspects of second language (L2) perceptual learning? A frequent assumption has been that nonnative speech perception can also account for the relative difficulties that late learners have with specific L2 segments and contrasts. However, evaluation of this assumption must take into account the fact that models of nonnative speech perception such as the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) have focused primarily on na\"ive listeners, whereas models of L2 speech acquisition such as the Speech Learning Model (SLM) have focused on experienced listeners. This chapter probes the assumption that L2 perceptual learning is determined by nonnative speech perception principles, by considering the commonalities and complementarities between inexperienced listeners and those learning an L2, as viewed from PAM and SLM. Among the issues examined are how language learning may affect perception of phonetic vs. phonological information, how monolingual vs. multiple language experience may impact perception, and what these may imply for attunement of speech perception to changes in the listener's language environment.},

This bilingual advantage was found not only for the traditionally demanding conditions, incongruent global-local trials and Trails B, but also for the conditions not usually considered to be cognitively demanding, congruent global-local trials and Trails A. All the children performed similarly when congruent trials were presented in a single block or perceptually simple stimuli were used, ruling out speed differences between the groups. The results demonstrate a bilingual advantage in processing complex stimuli in tasks that require executive processing components for conflict resolution, including switching and updating, even when no inhibition appears to be involved. They also suggest that simple conditions of the trail-making and global-local tasks involve some level of effortful processing for young children. Finally, the bilingual advantage in the trail-making task suggests that the interpretation of standardized measures of executive control needs to be reconsidered for children with specific experiences such as bilingualism.},

This article presents both a schematic history and the state of the art in primate vocalization research and its importance for speech emergence. Recent speech research advances allow more incisive comparison of phylogeny and ontogeny and also an illuminating reinterpretation of vintage primate vocalization data. This review produces three major findings. First, even among primates, laryngeal descent is not uniquely human. Second, laryngeal descent is not required to produce contrasting formant patterns in vocalizations. Third, living nonhuman primates produce vocalizations with contrasting formant patterns. Thus, evidence now overwhelmingly refutes the long-standing laryngeal descent theory, which pushes back ``the dawn of speech'' beyond \textasciitilde 200 ka ago to over \textasciitilde 20 Ma ago, a difference of two orders of magnitude.},

In a large-scale corpus analysis, we use parent-report data from over 32,000 children to estimate the acquisition trajectories of around 400 words in each of 10 languages, predicting them on the basis of independently derived properties of the words' linguistic environment (from corpora) and meaning (from adult judgments). We examine the consistency and variability of these predictors across languages, by lexical category, and over development. The patterning of predictors across languages is quite similar, suggesting similar processes in operation. In contrast, the patterning of predictors across different lexical categories is distinct, in line with theories that posit different factors at play in the acquisition of content words and function words. By leveraging data at a significantly larger scale than previous work, our analyses identify candidate generalizations about the processes underlying word learning across languages.},

In an eyetracking task, Dutch and Turkish four-year-olds (N = 40), five-year-olds (N = 58), and adults (N = 40) were presented with a visual display containing two familiar objects (e.g., a cake and a tree). Participants heard semantically constraining (e.g., ``The boy eats the big cake'') or neutral sentences (e.g., ``The boy sees the big cake'') in their native language. The Dutch data revealed a prediction effect for children and adults; however, it was larger for the adults. The Turkish data revealed no prediction effect for the children but only for the adults. These findings reveal that experience with word order structures and/or automatization of language processing routines may lead to timecourse differences in semantic prediction.},

In articulatory phonology, the basic units of phonological contrast tire gestures, which are also abstract characterizations of articulatory events, each with an intrinsic time or duration. Utterances are modeled as organized patterns (constellations) o f gestures, in which gestural units may over\- lap in time. The phonological structures defined in this way provide a set o f articulatorily based natural classes. Moreover, the patterns o f overlapping organization can be used to specify important aspects o f the phonological structure of particular languages, and to account, in a coherent and general way. for a variety o f different types of phonological variation. Such vari\- ation includes allophonic variation and fluent speech alterna\- tions. as well as `coarticulation' and speech errors. Finally, it is suggested that the gestural approach clarifies our understand\- ing o f phonological development, by positing that prel inguistic units o f action are harnessed into (gestural) phonological struc\- tures through differentiation and coordination.},

The study included eight bilingual Spanish- and English-speaking 3-year-olds and their monolingual peers (eight Spanish and eight American English). Phonological whole-word measures (pMLU and Proximity) and consonant accuracy (PCC) were calculated on elicited single words. Differences were found on each measure between bilinguals and monolinguals in English, but in Spanish, only the PCC displayed differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Bilinguals displayed language separation on the pMLU and the PCC but not the Proximity, indicating structural phonological differences between the Spanish and English of bilinguals but commensurate target approximations. This suggests that maintaining a consistent level of phonological proximity to the target is an important factor in phonological acquisition. The measures and their relationships are also discussed.},

Variables such as the particular languages of exposure, the community context, the onset of exposure, the amount of exposure, and socioeconomic status are crucial for describing any bilingual infant sample. Parent report is an effective approach for gathering data about infants' language experience. However, its quality is highly dependent on how information is elicited. This paper introduces a Multilingual Approach to Parent Language Estimates (MAPLE). MAPLE promotes best practices for using structured interviews to reliably elicit information from parents on bilingual infants' language background, with an emphasis on the challenging task of quantifying infants' relative exposure to each language. We discuss sensitive issues that must be navigated in this process, including diversity in family characteristics and cultural values. Finally, we identify six systematic effects that can impact parent report, and strategies for minimizing their influence.},

Concurrently, English vocabulary size was measured in the bilingual children of these parents. Most parents reported regular language mixing in interactions with their child. Increased rates of parental language mixing were associated with significantly smaller comprehension vocabularies in 1.5-year-old bilingual infants, and marginally smaller production vocabularies in 2-year-old bilingual children. Exposure to language mixing might obscure cues that facilitate young bilingual children's separation of their languages and could hinder the functioning of learning mechanisms that support the early growth of their vocabularies.},

A group of newborns whose mothers had spoken both Chinese and English showed an intermediate pattern of preference for Tagalog over English. Preference for two languages does not suggest confusion between them, however. Study 2 showed that both English monolingual newborns and Tagalog-English bilingual newborns could discriminate English from Tagalog.

Participants were 14 adults who stutter (M = 28 years) and 14 age/gender matched adults who do not stutter (M = 28 years). For the non-word repetition task, the participants had to repeat a set of 12 non-words across four syllable lengths (2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-syllables) (N = 48 total non-words). For the phoneme elision task, the participants repeated the same set of non-words at each syllable length, but with a designated target phoneme eliminated. Adults who stutter were significantly less accurate than adults who do not stutter in their initial attempts to produce the longest non-words (i.e., 7-syllable). Adults who stutter also required a significantly higher mean number of attempts to accurately produce 7-syllable non-words than adults who do not stutter. For the phoneme elision task, both groups demonstrated a significant reduction in accuracy as the non-words increased in length; however, there was no significant interaction between group and syllable length. Thus, although there appear to be advancements in the phonological working memory for adults who stutter relative to children who stutter, preliminary data from the present study suggest that the advancements may not be comparable to those demonstrated by adults who do not stutter.},

Central constructs are not well defined; inappropriate research methods have been used; the right kind of data is not discussed. Crucially, authors prevaricate on the notion of language itself, switching between cognitive and environmental perspectives.

Results from three age groups of Chinese-English bilingual children showed that speech perception was more predictive of reading and vocabulary in the L1 than L2. While morphological awareness uniquely predicted reading and vocabulary in both languages, phonological awareness played such a role after controlling for morphological awareness only in the L2, which was alphabetic. L1 speech perception and metalinguistic awareness predicted L2 word reading but not vocabulary, after controlling for the corresponding L2 variables. Hence, there are both similarities and differences between the two languages in how the constructs are related. The differences are attributable to variations in language properties and learning contexts. Implications of the present results for an effective L2 learning program are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To determine the psychometric properties of the Preschool Repetition Test (Roy \& Chiat, 2004); to establish the range of performance in typically developing children and variables affecting this; and to compare the performance of clinically referred children.
Method: The PSRep Test comprises 18 words and 18 phonologically matched nonwords systematically varied for length and prosodic structure. This test was administered to a `typical' sample of children aged 2;0\textendash 4;0 (n=315) and a `clinic' sample of children aged 2;6-4;0 (n=168), together with language assessments.
Results: Performance in the typical sample was independent of gender and SES, but was affected by age, item length, and prosodic structure, and was moderately correlated with receptive vocabulary. Performance in the clinic sample was significantly poorer, but revealed similar effects of length and prosody, and similar relations to language measures overall, with some notable exceptions. Test-retest and interrater reliability were high.
Conclusions: The PSRep Test is a viable and informative test. It differentiates within and between `typical' and `clinic' samples of children, and reveals some unusual profiles within the clinic sample. These findings lay the foundations for a follow-up study of the clinic sample to investigate the predictive value of the test.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effects of morpheme boundaries on intergestural timing, and demonstrates that low-level phonetic realization is influenced by morphological structure, i.e. compounding and affixation. It reports two experiments, one using electromagnetic midsagittal articulography (EMA) and one electropalatography (EPG), examining Korean data. The results of the EMA study show that intergestural timing is less variable for adjacent gestures across the word boundary inside a lexicalized compound than inside a nonlexicalized compound, and inside a monomorphemic word than across a morpheme boundary. The EPG study (which examined the timing in palatalization of a coronal) shows that both [ti] and [ni] have more variability in gestural timing when heteromorphemic than when tautomorphemic. Furthermore, the phonetic details of gestural overlap shed light on the asymmetry on palatalization between tautomorphemic and heteromorphemic gestural sequences (e.g. ni vs. n-i ), presumably driven by paradigmatic contrast and preference of overlap. In short, what emerges from two experiments is that gestures are coordinated more stably within a single lexical item (a morpheme or a lexicalized compound) than across a boundary between lexical items. In accounting for the stability of intergestural timing within a lexical entry, several hypotheses were discussed including the Phase Window, Bonding Strength, Phonological Timing and Extended Phase Window model newly proposed here. The implication is that the morphological structure may be encoded in the phonetic realization, as is the case with other linguistic structure (e.g. prosodic structure).},

Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22, pp. 1\textendash 75.], syllables play a crucial role at the interface of phonological and phonetic encoding. At this interface, abstract phonological syllables are translated into phonetic syllables. It is assumed that this translation process is mediated by a so-called Mental Syllabary. Rather than constructing the motor programs for each syllable on-line, the mental syllabary is hypothesized to provide pre-compiled gestural scores for the articulators. In order to find evidence for such a repository, we investigated syllable-frequency effects: If the mental syllabary consists of retrievable representations corresponding to syllables, then the retrieval process should be sensitive to frequency differences. In a series of experiments using a symbol-position association learning task, we tested whether highfrequency syllables are retrieved and produced faster compared to low-frequency syllables. We found significant syllable frequency effects with monosyllabic pseudo-words and disyllabic pseudo-words in which the first syllable bore the frequency manipulation; no effect was found when the frequency manipulation was on the second syllable. The implications of these results for the theory of word form encoding at the interface of phonological and phonetic encoding; especially with respect to the access mechanisms to the mental syllabary in the speech production model by (Levelt et al.) are discussed.},

Method\textemdash Twenty-one children with SLI (8;7\textendash 11;11 [years;months]) and 21 age-matched controls participated in categorical perception tasks using four series of syllables for which perceived syllable-initial voicing varied. Series were either words or abstract nonword syllables and either synthesized or high-quality edited natural utterances. Children identified and discriminated (a) digitally edited tokens of naturally spoken ``bowl''\textendash ''pole'', (b) synthesized renditions of ``bowl''\textendash ''pole'', (c) natural ``ba''\textendash ''pa'', and (d) synthetic ``ba''\textendash ''pa''.
Results\textemdash Identification crossover locations were the same for both groups of children, but there was modestly less accuracy on unambiguous endpoints for children with SLI. Planned comparisons revealed these effects to be limited to synthesized speech. Children with SLI showed overall reduced discrimination, but these effects were limited to abstract nonword syllables.
Conclusion\textemdash Overall, children with SLI perceived naturally spoken real words comparably to age-matched peers but showed impaired identification and discrimination of synthetic speech and of abstract syllables. Poor performance on speech perception tasks may result from task demands and stimulus properties, not perceptual deficits.},

In the present investigation, neighbourhood analyses of two children's (age 3;6) expressive lexicons, maternal input, and an adult lexicon were conducted. In addition to raw counts and frequency-weighted counts, neighbourhood size was calculated as the proportion of the lexicon to which each target word is similar, to normalize for vocabulary size differences. These analyses revealed that children's lexicons contain more similar sounding words than previous analyses indicated. Further, neighbourhoods appear denser earlier in development relative to vocabulary size, presumably because children first learn words with more frequent sounds and sound combinations. Neighbourhood density as a proportion of the size of the lexicon then decreases over development as children acquire words with less frequent sounds and sound combinations. These findings suggest that positing fundamentally different lexical representations for children may be premature.},

After partialling out ease of articulation and lexical variables, both groups of children repeated higher phonotactic frequency nonwords more accurately than they did low phonotactic frequency nonwords, suggesting sensitivity to phoneme frequency. In addition, sensitivity to individual phonetic segments increased with age. Finally, older children, but not younger children, were sensitive to the frequency of larger (diphone) units.

  abstract = {Research on probabilistic pronunciation variation has generally focused on contextual probability, or the probability of using a linguistic unit (segment, syllable, word, etc.) in the context of a particular utterance. Overwhelmingly, this research has found that higher contextual probability leads to phonetic reduction. Less attention, however, has been given to paradigmatic probability, or the probability of using a particular linguistic form from a paradigm of related forms. The research that has addressed this type of probability has found inconsistent results: Sometimes higher paradigmatic probability leads to phonetic enhancement, and sometimes to phonetic reduction. In this paper I present the results of an experiment exploring the effects of both types of probability simultaneously on the pronunciation of agreement suffixes on English verbs. I find that (i) singular verb suffixes and stems are phonetically reduced when singular agreement is contextually probable; (ii) the nature of the reduction is modulated by verb frequency, consistent with dual-route models of lexical retrieval; and (iii) suffixes are phonetically enhanced when they are paradigmatically probable. I conclude by discussing how the patterns observed in this study shed light on the previous contradictory findings regarding the effects of paradigmatic probability on pronunciation.},

I argue that both parallel and oppositional alignments are predicted by the two possible innovation-types children make when solving the Mapping Problem (Clark 1977, 1993, i.a.); in short, different L1A processes underlie different types of change. I further argue that input-divergent analyses at most need to persist into the teenage years, when they can be diffused via the sociolinguistic change powerhouse of teenage peer groups (e.g. Labov 2012), and may also be reinforced and prolonged in childhood via peer-to-peer acquisition and bilingualism contexts.},

To date, the only empirical support for this statistical learning hypothesis comes from studies where a single, salient dimension was manipulated. Additional evidence is sought here, by introducing a less salient pair of categories supported by multiple cues. We exposed English-learning infants to a multi-cue bidimensional grid between retroflex and alveolopalatal sibilants in prevocalic position. This contrast is substantially more difficult according to previous cross-linguistic and perceptual research, and its perception is driven by cues in both the consonantal and the following vowel portions. Infants heard one of two distributions (flat, or with two peaks), and were tested with sounds varying along only one dimension. Infants' responses differed depending on the familiarization distribution, and their performance was equally good for the vocalic and the frication dimension, lending some support to the statistical hypothesis even in this harder learning situation. However, learning was restricted to the retroflex category, and a control experiment showed that lack of learning for the alveolopalatal category was not due to the presence of a competing category. Thus, these results contribute fundamental evidence on the extent and limitations of the statistical hypothesis as an explanation for infants' perceptual tuning.},

  author = {Cristi{\`a}, Alejandrina},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {To what extent does language acquisition recruit domain-general processing mech- anisms? In this dissertation, evidence concerning this question is garnered from the study of individual differences in infant speech perception and their predictive value with respect to language development in early childhood. In the first experiment, variation in the processing of a linguistic unit at six months was found to predict vocabulary development at around 2 years of age, whereas processing of a non-unit did not. In the second experiment, one possible source for that variation in linguis- tic performance was assessed, namely information processing abilities. Infants were tested on the same linguistic task as in Experiment 1, and on a well-researched task that yields a measure of information processing in infancy. No covariance was found between measures gathered in the linguistic and the information processing tasks. In a third experiment, the impact of variation in the infants' input on their speech processing was investigated. Correlations between infants' performance in a speech sound discrimination task and acoustic characteristics of their primary caregivers' speech were investigated. Two types of acoustic characteristics were measured; some were not relevant to the speech sound being tested, but are known to influence in- fants' attention and learning (pitch and pitch modulations); others were specific to the contrast tested. Results suggested that only those characteristics relevant to the contrast being tested affected infants' speech processing. In sum, these three experiments and extensive literature reviews suggest specific ways in which domain- general factors (such as attentional mechanisms) are involved in infants' development of linguistic knowledge. While these factors appear to play a role in the learning of phonological units, their influence may not be evident once linguistic categories are already established.},

  abstract = {In the previous decade, dozens of studies involving thousands of children across several research disciplines have made use of a combined daylong audio-recorder and automated algorithmic analysis called the LENAR system, which aims to assess children's language environment. While the system's prevalence in the language acquisition domain is steadily growing, there are only scattered validation efforts, on only some of its key characteristics. Here, we assess the LENAR system's accuracy across all of its key measures: speaker classification, adult word counts (AWC), child vocalization counts (CVC), and conversational turn counts (CTC). Our assessment is based on manual annotation of clips that have been randomly or periodically sampled out of daylong recordings, collected from (a) populations similar to LENAR`s original training data (North American English-learning children aged 3-36 months), (b) children learning another dialect of English (UK), and (c) slightly older children growing up in a different linguistic and socio-cultural setting (Tsimane' learners in rural Bolivia). We find reasonably high accuracy in some measures (AWC, CTC), with more problematic levels of performance in others (CTC, precision and recall of male adults and other children). We find little difference in accuracy as a function of child age, dialect, or socio-cultural setting. Whether LENAR results are accurate enough for a given research, educational, or clinical application depends largely on the specifics at hand. We therefore conclude with a set of recommendations to help researchers make this determination for their goals.},

Audio data, particularly real-world audio recordings, are of particular interest to behavioral scientists because they provide high-fidelity access to subtle aspects of daily life and social interactions. However, these methodological advances pose novel risks to research participants and communities. In this article, we outline the benefits and challenges associated with collecting, analyzing, and sharing multi-hour audio recording data. Guided by the principles of autonomy, privacy, beneficence, and justice, we propose a set of ethical guidelines for the use of longform audio recordings in behavioral research.

  abstract = {Although early life experiences of language and parenting are critical for children's development, large home observation studies of both domains are scarce in the psychological literature, presumably because of their considerable costs to the participants and researchers. Here, we used digital audio-recorders to unobtrusively observe 107 children, aged 2.03 to 3.99 years (M ϭ 2.77, SD ϭ 0.55), and their families over 3 days (M ϭ 15.06 hr per day, SD ϭ 1.87). The recording software estimated the total number of words that a child heard over the course of a day. In addition, we transcribed six 5-min excerpts per family (i.e., 30 min overall) to extract estimates of children's and their parents' lexical diversity, positive and critical parenting, and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We found that home language input (i.e., number of words and lexical diversity) was positively associated with children's cognitive ability and lexical diversity but not with their behaviors. In addition, we observed that home language input varied as much within as between families across days (intraclass correlation ϭ .47). By comparison, parenting predicted children's behavioral outcomes but was not related to their cognitive or lexical ability. Overall, our findings suggest that home language input affects child development in cognition and language, while positive and parenting informs their behavioral development. Furthermore, we demonstrated that digital audio-recordings are useful tools for home observation studies that seek to disentangle the complex relationships between early life home environments and child development.},

(2017) have proposed that variations in the timing, quality and quantity of language input during the earliest stages of development are related to variations in the development of phonological working memory and, in turn, to later language learning outcomes. To examine this hypothesis, three groups of children who are at-risk for language learning were examined: children with cochlear implants (CI), children with developmental language disorder (DLD), and internationally-adopted (IA) children, Comparison groups of typically-developing monolingual (MON) children and second language (L2) learners were also included. All groups were acquiring French as a first or second language and were matched on age, gender, and socioeconomic status, as well as other group-specific factors; they were between 5;0\textendash 7;3 years of age at time of testing. The CI and DLD groups scored significantly more poorly on the memory measures than the other groups; while the IA and L2 groups did not differ from one another. While the IA group performed more poorly than the MON group, there was no difference between the L2 and MON groups. We also found differential developmental relationships between phonological memory and language among the groups of interest in comparison to the typically-developing MON and L2 groups supporting the hypothesis that language experiences early in life are consequential for language development because of their effects on the development of phonological memory.},

Recent studies suggest that some of this variability may be due to phonological constraints. This paper explored this issue further by conducting a longitudinal study of five Englishspeaking one- to two-year-olds' acquisition of articles. It found that most children were more likely to produce articles when these could be produced as part of a disyllabic foot. However, acoustic analysis revealed that one child initially produced all articles as independent prosodic words. These findings confirm that some of the variable production of articles is conditioned by constraints on children's early phonologies, providing further support for the Prosodic Licensing Hypothesis. They also hold important implications for our understanding of the emergence of syntactic knowledge.},

We traced those cephalograms and identified landmarks to delineate the front and back cavities. The sagittal areas of the front and back cavities were calculated. A measure of the angle of the head to the cervical vertebrae was made. Results: Front cavities were larger and grew faster. For both front and back cavities, age, angle measure, and the interaction of age and angle measure were significant.

Design: Relationships between maternal contributions and children's language skills were investigated by using correlation and regression analyses. Thirty-two mothers (mean age ؍ 36.0 yr) and their children (mean age ؍ 4.8 yr) were videotaped during free play and storybook interactions. Mothers' and children's quantitative (MLU, number of wordtypes) and mothers' qualitative (facilitative language techniques) linguistic input were analyzed. Mothers completed a measurement tool specifically designed to quantify their sense of involvement and self-efficacy (Scale of Parental Involvement and Self-Efficacy). The Reynell Developmental Language Scales and data from videotaped transcription analyses were used to evaluate children's oral and sign language skills.
Results: Maternal involvement and self-efficacy relating to children's speech-language development were positively related to mothers' quantitative and qualitative linguistic input. After controlling for child's age, mothers' MLU and two facilitative language techniques (recast and open-ended question) were positively related to children's language skills.
Conclusions: The performance of young implant users may vary in part because of their mothers' sense of involvement and self-efficacy, as well as the ways in which mothers interact with their children. Given this information, it would be fruitful for professionals working with these families to incorporate goals that enhance caregivers' involvement, self-efficacy, and linguistic input to better support language development in young children after cochlear implantation.},

Extensive evidence has highlighted the central role of phonological awareness in early literacy experiences. However, many orthographic systems also require the contribution of morphological awareness. The goal of this study was to examine the morphological and phonological awareness skills of preschool children as longitudinal predictors of reading and spelling ability by the end of first grade, controlling for the effects of receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. At Time 1 preschool children from kindergartens in the Greek regions of Attika, Crete, Macedonia, and Thessaly were assessed on tasks tapping receptive and expressive vocabulary, phonological awareness (syllable and phoneme), and morphological awareness (inflectional and derivational). Tasks were administered through an Android application for mobile devices (tablets) featuring automatic application of ceiling rules. At Time 2 one year later the same children attending first grade were assessed on measures of word and pseudoword reading, text reading fluency, text reading comprehension, and spelling. Complete data from 104 children are available. Hierarchical linear regression and commonality analyses were conducted for each outcome variable. Reading accuracy for both words and pseudowords was predicted not only by phonological awareness, as expected, but also by morphological awareness, suggesting that understanding the functional role of word parts supports the developing phonology\textendash orthography mappings. However, only phonological awareness predicted text reading fluency at this age. Longitudinal prediction of reading comprehension by both receptive vocabulary and morphological awareness was already evident at this age, as expected. Finally, spelling was predicted by preschool phonological awareness, as expected, as well as by morphological awareness, the contribution of which is expected to increase due to the spelling demands of Greek inflectional and derivational suffixes introduced at later grades.},

In-depth acoustic analysis was conducted on tokens of the word like from the girls' speech. This is a word with a number of different grammatical functions, such as quotative like (I was LIKE ``yeah okay''), discourse particle like (It was LIKE so boring), and lexical verb like (I LIKE your socks). The results provide evidence that the different functions of like can vary systematically in terms of their phonetic realisations and that the realisations of some phonetic variables may vary depending on a combination of a word's function and the social group of the speaker who produced it. Additionally, the results provide evidence of a relationship between phonetic reduction and an individual speaker's probability of using like when producing a quotative. This finding lends support to probabilistic models of speech production where activation is not filtered through a phonological buffer and where there is a link between lemma-based and acoustically rich information.},

The goal of this study was to determine if age at implantation has a significant, lasting impact on speech perception, language, and reading performance for children with prelingual hearing loss. Design\textemdash A linear mixed model framework was utilized to determine the effect of age at implantation on speech perception, language, and reading abilities in 83 children with prelingual hearing loss who received cochlear implants by age 4. The children were divided into two groups based on their age at implantation: 1) under 2 years of age and 2) between 2 and 3.9 years of age. Differences in model specified mean scores between groups were compared at annual intervals from 5 to 13 years of age for speech perception, and 7 to 11 years of age for language and reading.
Results\textemdash After controlling for communication mode, device configuration, and pre-operative pure-tone average, there was no significant effect of age at implantation for receptive language by 8 years of age, expressive language by 10 years of age, reading by 7 years of age. In terms of speech perception outcomes, significance varied between 7 and 13 years of age, with no significant difference in speech perception scores between groups at ages 7, 11 and 13 years. Children who utilized oral communication (OC) demonstrated significantly higher speech perception scores than children who used total communication (TC). OC users tended to have higher expressive language scores than TC users, although this did not reach significance. There was no significant difference between OC and TC users for receptive language or reading scores.
Conclusions\textemdash Speech perception, language, and reading performance continue to improve over time for children implanted before 4 years of age. The current results indicate that the effect of age},

  abstract = {While broad-focus comparisons of consonant inventories across children acquiring different language can suggest that phonological development follows a universal sequence, finer-grained statistical comparisons can reveal systematic differences. This cross-linguistic study of word-initial lingual obstruents examined some effects of language-specific frequencies on consonant mastery. Repetitions of real words were elicited from 2- and 3-year-old children who were monolingual speakers of English, Cantonese, Greek, or Japanese. The repetitions were recorded and transcribed by an adult native speaker for each language. Results found support for both language-universal effects in phonological acquisition and for language-specific influences related to phoneme and phoneme sequence frequency. These results suggest that acquisition patterns that are common across languages arise in two ways. One influence is direct, via the universal constraints imposed by the physiology and physics of speech production and perception, and how these predict which contrasts will be easy and which will be difficult for the child to learn to control. The other influence is indirect, via the way universal principles of ease of perception and production tend to influence the lexicons of many languages through commonly attested sound changes.},

To test this account of phonological processing, production accuracy and fluency were examined in nonword repetitions by children and adults. Stimuli were 22 pairs of nonwords, in which one contained a low-frequency or unattested two-phoneme sequence while the other contained a high-frequency sequence. For a subset of these nonword pairs, segment durations were measured. The same sound was produced with a longer duration (less fluently) when it appeared in a low-frequency sequence, as compared to a high-frequency sequence. Low-frequency sequences were also repeated with lower accuracy than high-frequency sequences. Moreover, children with larger vocabularies showed a smaller influence of frequency on accuracy than children with smaller vocabularies. These results support the claim that speakers develop a phonological system based on incremental generalizations over the lexicon.},

In a longitudinal natural study, six mothers' ADS and IDS were recorded on 10 occasions during the first 6 months after their infants were born. Acoustic\textendash phonetic measures, including the first two formant frequencies and duration for vowels and the duration of the fricative /s/, were used to test the MIPhI model with differences between IDS and ADS during the infants' first 6 months. Repeated measures analyses showed the fricative /s/ duration was stably longer in IDS, corresponding to an overspecification throughout the 6 months. The unexpected smaller vowel space for IDS than ADS was stably maintained over the six months, suggesting an underspecification of vowels. Vowel duration, which was generally longer in IDS than ADS, however, changed over time, decreasing in difference between IDS and ADS during month 3 and 4. Results invite adjustments to the MIPhI model, in particular related to infants' needs for perceptual enhancement of speech segments, and to the course of infant neurological and communicative development throughout the first 6 months.

Simulations demonstrate that word-level information can successfully disambiguate overlapping English vowel categories. Learning patterns in the model are shown to parallel human behavior from artificial language learning tasks.

Parentese, a near-universal speaking style distinguished by higher pitch, slower tempo, and exaggerated intonation, has been documented in speech directed toward young children in many countries. Previous research shows that the use of parentese and parent\textendash child turn-taking are both associated with advances in children's language learning. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a parent coaching intervention delivered when the infants are 6, 10, and 14 mo of age can enhance parental language input and whether this, in turn, changes the trajectory of child language development between 6 and 18 mo of age. Families of typically developing 6-mo-old infants (
              n
              = 71) were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Naturalistic first-person audio recordings of the infants' home language environment and vocalizations were recorded when the infants were 6, 10, 14, and 18 mo of age. After the 6-, 10-, and 14-mo recordings, intervention, but not control parents attended individual coaching appointments to receive linguistic feedback, listen to language input in their own recordings, and discuss age-appropriate activities that promote language growth. Intervention significantly enhanced parental use of parentese and parent\textendash child turn-taking between 6 and 18 mo. Increases in both variables were significantly correlated with children's language growth during the same period, and children's language outcomes at 18 mo. Using parentese, a socially and linguistically enhanced speaking style, improves children's social language turn-taking and language skills. Research-based interventions targeting social aspects of parent\textendash child interactions can enhance language outcomes.},

              This study compares the prosodie modifications in mothers' and fathers' speech to preverbal infants in French, Italian, German, Japanese, British English, and American English. At every stage of data collection and analysis, standardized procedures were used to enhance the comparability across data sets that is essential for valid cross-language comparison of the prosodie features of parental speech. In each of the six language groups, five mothers and five fathers were recorded in semi-structured home observations while speaking to their infant aged 0; 10\textendash 1;2 and to an adult. Speech samples were instrumentally analysed to measure seven prosodic parameters: mean fundamental frequency (f

American English parents showed the most extreme prosodic modifications, differing from the other language groups in the extent of intonational exaggeration in Speech to infants. These results reveal common patterns in caretaker's use of intonation across languages, which may function developmentally to regulate infant arousal and attention, to communicate affect, and to facilitate speech perception and language comprehension. In addition to providing evidence for possibly universal prosodic features of speech to infants, these results suggest that language-specific variations are also important, and that the findings of the numerous studies of early language input based on American English are not necessarily generalisable to other cultures.},

The research includes the role of touch in early development, touch deprivation, touch aversion, emotions that can be conveyed by touch, the importance of touch for interpersonal relationships and how friendly touch affects compliance in different situations. MRI data are reviewed showing activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate cortex during affective touch. Physiological and biochemical effects of touch are also reviewed including decreased heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol and increased oxytocin. Similar changes noted following moderate pressure massage appear to be mediated by the stimulation of pressure receptors and increased vagal activity. Increased serotonin and decreased substance P may explain its pain-alleviating effects. Positive shifts in frontal EEG also accompany moderate pressure massage along with increased attentiveness, decreased depression and enhanced immune function including increased natural killer cells, making massage therapy one of the most effective forms of touch.},

In Experiment 1, 2.5-year-olds more accurately identified novel words that had been presented just twice in an initial study phase than nonwords that had not been presented, showing auditory priming for nonwords. Experiments 2, 3, and 4 revealed that the sound representations underlying auditory priming in young children, as in adults, include both abstract and token-specific information about the sounds of new words. In Experiment 2, 3-year-olds showed priming for studied nonsense syllables that changed both token and recorded context from study to test, compared to entirely new test syllables. In Experiment 3, 3-year-olds more accurately identified nonsense syllables that were the same tokens in the same context at study and test than syllables that changed token and context from study to test. In Experiment 4, 3year-olds more accurately identified the same-token syllables from Experiment 3, even when those syllables were presented in isolation, spliced out of their original contexts. Thus children's rapidly formed representations of new spoken words include both components abstract enough to identify the same sound sequence across changes in word token and changes in phonetic context, and components specific to the originally presented token. We argue that the powerful perceptual learning mechanism underlying auditory word priming has the right properties to play a central role in the development of the auditory lexicon.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an investigation of the speech of children aged 2 to 4 from Newcastle upon Tyne. Our aim is to understand how variant phonetic patterns come to be acquired. These patterns include both phonologically governed alternations, such as the aspirated allophone of word-initial (t), and also sociolinguistically correlated variants. A baseline for this study is provided by a previous project focusing on Newcastle adults, which revealed variation and change in the pronunciation of several consonants and vowels. We concentrate here on 10 children's productions of (t), a particularly complex variable in adult speech. The children demonstrate a sophisticated mastery of many aspects of the adult patterns, producing qualitatively different phonetic variants in appropriate phonological contexts. The acoustic qualities of the allophones in general closely resemble those of adults. Where gender-based differences occur in the local adult community, both boys and girls adhere more closely to the patterns typical of women. This suggests that at this stage of development children are most influenced by the phonological/phonetic patterns of their mothers. We conclude that it is problematic to view acquisition of language-specific phonological units as separate from the accent-specific variation which is important in the construction of a sociolinguistic identity. We also suggest that structured variation in the adult input, although usually characterised as dysfunctional in child-centred research, may in fact serve a positive function in the acquisition process. Specifically, children may exploit recurrent patterns in the input signal to help them locate the phonological components of words and achieve the transition from a system of holistic lexical representation to one involving more abstract categorial units.},

This ``anticipatory'' shortening is much greater than ``backward'' shortening whereby an unstressed syllable is measured to shorten a following stressed syllable. We speculated that measured shortening reflects, not true shortening, but coarticulatory hiding. Hence, we asked whether listeners are sensitive to parts of stressed syllables hidden by following or preceding unstressed syllables. In two experiments, we found the point of subjective equality, that is the durational difference between a stressed syllable in isolation and one followed by an unstressed syllable, at which listeners cannot tell which is longer. A third experiment found the point of subjective equality for stressed monosyllables and disyllables with a weak-strong stress pattern. In all experiments, the points of subjective equality occurred when stressed syllables in disyllables were measured to be shorter than those in monosyllables as if listeners hear the coarticulatory onsest or continuation of a stressed syllable within unstressed syllables.},

In this study of 4- to 6-year-olds, we examine whether aspects of the home literacy environment are differentially associated with phonological awareness. Parental responses to a questionnaire about the home literacy environment are compared to children's awareness of rhyme and phonemes, as well as to their vocabulary, letter knowledge, and performance on measures of phonological strength (nonword repetition, rapid naming skill, phonological distinctness, and auditory discrimination). The results showed that a teaching focus in the home literacy environment and exposure to reading-related media are directly associated with phoneme awareness and indirectly associated via letter knowledge and vocabulary. Exposure to reading-related media and parents' active involvement in children's literature were also directly and indirectly linked with rhyme awareness skills via their association with letter and vocabulary knowledge.},

Explanations for phonetic reduction of predictable forms tend to take one of two approaches: Intelligibility-based accounts hold that talkers maximize intelligibility of words that might otherwise be difficult to recognize; production-based accounts hold that variation reflects the speed of lexical access and retrieval in the language production system. Here we examine phonetic variation as a function of phonological neighborhood density, capitalizing on the fact that words from dense phonological neighborhoods tend to be relatively difficult to recognize, yet easy to produce. We show that words with many phonological neighbors tend to be phonetically reduced (shortened in duration and produced with more centralized vowels) in connected speech, when other predictors of phonetic variation are brought under statistical control. We argue that our findings are consistent with the predictions of production-based accounts of pronunciation variation.},

Ten families of children aged between 22 and 42 months, recruited near Ho Chi Minh City, participated in this project. Each child wore the LENA audio recorder for a full day. Two native speakers listened to 10-min extracts of the recordings from each family and labeled conversational turns according to the coding protocol. Their results were compared with the findings from the LENA software. A Spearman rank correlation test indicated a strong level of correlation between the LENA software and the human coders, r (18) = .70, p {$<$} .001. The LENA System's CTC provides a reasonably s accurate estimate of conversational turns in Vietnamese recordings, showing that this protocol can yield significant results. Discrepancies between the coders and the software are discussed, and the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed protocol are highlighted.},

Basic findings relating nonword repetition and word learning both in typical samples of children and adults and in individuals with disorders of language learning are described. The theoretical analysis of this evidence is organized around the following claims: first, that nonword repetition and word learning both rely on phonological storage; second, that they are both multiply determined, constrained also by auditory, phonological, and speech\textendash motor output processes; third, that a phonological storage deficit alone may not be sufficient to impair language learning to a substantial degree. It is concluded that word learning mediated by temporary phonological storage is a primitive learning mechanism that is particularly important in the early stages of acquiring a language, but remains available to support word learning across the life span.},

Relative advantages of receiving a bilateral CI after age 4.5, better pre-CI aided hearing, and longer CI experience were also examined.
Method\textemdash Sixty children participated in a prospective longitudinal study of outcomes at 4.5 and 10.5 years of age. Twenty-nine children received a sequential second CI. Test scores were compared to normative samples of hearing age-mates and predictors of outcomes identified.
Results\textemdash Standard scores on language tests at 10.5 years of age remained significantly correlated with age of first cochlear implantation. Scores were not associated with receipt of a second, sequentially-acquired CI. Significantly higher scores were achieved for vocabulary as compared with overall language, a finding not evident when the children were tested at younger ages.
Conclusion\textemdash Age-appropriate spoken language skills continued to be more likely with younger AOI, even after an average of 8.6 years of additional CI use. Receipt of a second implant between ages 4\textendash 10 years and longer duration of device use did not provide significant added benefit.},

Results indicated that lexical di\OE usion of fricatives occurred di\OE erentially by word position. Positional, featural and structural markedness further converged such that change in unmarked structure of any type was implemented in low frequency words. A child's presenting fricative inventory was not directly a liated with systematic patterns of di\OE usion.

Their babbling utterances were compared to the babbling of six English-learning children between 9 and 22 months of age. Child patterns for both languages were compared with Quichua and English ambient language patterns. Babbling output was highly similar for the child groups: Quichua and English children's babbling demonstrated similar predicted within-syllable (coronal-front vowel, labial-central vowel, dorsal-back vowel) patterns, and across-syllable manner variegation patterns for consonants. These patterns were observed at significantly greater rates in the child groups than in the respective adult language input patterns, suggesting production system influences common to children across languages rather than ambient language perceptual learning effects during these children's babbling period.},

Parents completed additional recordings and language assessments over a 9-month follow-up phase. Aggregate analyses found no differences in language behaviors between immediate-treatment versus delayed-treatment groups. However, parents who started from below average ratings on automated language measures demonstrated significant postintervention increases which held longitudinally. Importantly, participant children showed significant elevations in language ability. Results suggest that an online intervention approach can help some parents increase talk and interaction in the home. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.},

Method\textemdash Upper and lower lip movements were recorded from 8 young adults and 8 children (aged 4\textendash 5 years). A single rounded versus unrounded vowel was embedded in the medial position of pairs of 7-word/7-syllable sentences.
Results\textemdash Both children and adults produced movement trajectories associated with lip rounding that were very broad temporally (i.e., movement duration lasting 45\% to 56\% of the sentence). Some effects appeared to extend across the entire utterance. There were no differences between children and adults in the extent of the coarticulatory effect. However, children produced relatively variable movements associated with lip rounding.
Conclusions\textemdash These data support the hypothesis that, for young children and adults, broad chunks of output have been planned by the onset of implementation of a sentence. This implies that, based on a change in a single phoneme, the motor commands to the muscles are altered for the production of the entire sentence.},

Method: Thirty individuals participated: 10 young adults, 10 children who are normally developing, and 10 children diagnosed with specific language impairment. Segmental error and segmental variability and movement trajectory variability were compared in low and high prosodic prominence conditions (i.e., strong and weak syllables) and in different prosodic foot structures.
Results: Between-participants findings were that both groups of children showed more segmental error and segmental variability and more movement trajectory variability than did adults. A similar within-participant pattern of results was observed for all 3 groups. Prosodic prominence influenced both segmental and motor levels of analysis, with weak syllables produced less accurately and with more lip and jaw movement trajectory variability than strong syllables. However, hierarchical foot structure affected segmental but not motor measures of speech production accuracy and variability.
Conclusions: Motor and segmental variables were not consistently aligned. This pattern of results has clinical implication because inferences about motor variability may not directly follow from observations of segmental variability.},

As a result, there are few studies of mechanisms underlying developmental changes in prelinguistic vocal production. Here we report the first evidence that caregivers' speech to babbling infants provides crucial, real-time guidance to the development of prelinguistic vocalizations. Mothers of 9.5-month-old infants were instructed to provide models of vocal production timed to be either contingent or noncontingent on their infants' babbling. Infants given contingent feedback rapidly restructured their babbling, incorporating phonological patterns from caregivers' speech, but infants given noncontingent feedback did not. The new vocalizations of the infants in the contingent condition shared phonological form but not phonetic content with their mothers' speech. Thus, prelinguistic infants learned new vocal forms by discovering phonological patterns in their mothers' contingent speech and then generalizing from these patterns.},

However, matching the context in order to apply the correct rule depends crucially on the parsing quality of the Spanish input. As the form of the subordinated verb depends heavily on the conjunction in the subordinated Spanish clause and the semantics of the main verb, we extracted this information from two treebanks and trained different classifiers on this data.

However, evidence from children's systematic errors suggests that children first build a repertoire of words as integral sequences of gestures and then gradually differentiate these sequences into their gestural and segmental components. Recently, experimental support for this position has been found in the acoustic records of the speech of 3-, 5- and 7-year-old children suggesting that even in older children some phonemes have not yet fully segregated as units of gestural organization and control. The present longitudinal study extends this work to younger children (22- and 32-month-olds).

  abstract = {This paper considers the approaches and methods for reducing the influence of multicollinearity. Great attention is paid to the question of using shrinkage estimators for this purpose. Two classes of regression models are investigated, the first of which corresponds to systems with a negative feedback, while the second class presents systems without the feedback. In the first case the use of shrinkage estimators, especially the Principal Component estimator, is inappropriate but is possible in the second case with the right choice of the regularization parameter or of the number of principal components included in the regression model. This fact is substantiated by the study of the distribution of the random variable b{${'}$}b - {$\beta$} {${'}\beta$} , where b is the LS estimate and {$\beta$} is the true coefficient, since the form of this distribution is the basic characteristic of the specified classes. For this study, a regression approximation of the distribution of the event b{${'}$}b - {$\beta$} {${'}\beta$} {$<$} 0 based on the Edgeworth series was developed. Also, alternative approaches are examined to resolve the multicollinearity issue, including an application of the known Inequality Constrained Least Squares method and the Dual estimator method proposed by the author. It is shown that with a priori information the Euclidean distance between the estimates and the true coefficients can be significantly reduced.},

Productions of syllables containing bilabial consonants were observed from speakers in four age groups (i.e., 1-year-olds, 2-year-olds, 6-year-olds, and young adults). A video-based movement tracking system was used to transduce movement of the upper lip, lower lip, and jaw. The coordinative organization of these articulatory gestures was shown to change dramatically during the first several years of life and to continue to undergo refinement past age 6. The present results are consistent with three primary phases in the development of lip and jaw coordination for speech: integration, differentiation, and refinement. Each of these developmental processes entails the existence of distinct coordinative constraints on early articulatory movement. It is suggested that these constraints will have predictable consequences for the sequence of phonologic development.},

These recordings were processed automatically using a measurement framework based on the work of Hart and Risley. Like Hart and Risley, the current findings indicated vast differences in individual children's home language environments (i.e., adult word count), children's vocalizations, and conversational turns.Automated processing compared favorably to the original Hart and Risley estimates that were based on transcription. Adding to Hart and Risley's findings were new descriptions of patterns of daily talk and relationships to widely used outcome measures, among others. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The present study explored articulator movement variability during voicing contrast acquisition. The purpose was to examine whether oral articulator movement trajectories associated with the production of voiced/voiceless bilabial phonemes in children became less variable over time.
Method: Jaw, lower lip, and upper lip movements were recorded longitudinally in six, 19 month-old children as they began producing the voiceless phoneme /p/. Displacement signals were time and amplitude normalized. The spatiotemporal index (A. Smith, L. Goffman, H. Zelaznik, S. Ying, \& C. McGillem, 1995) was computed to examine the variability in movement trajectories across repeated productions of target utterances.
Results: Spatiotemporal variability of lip and jaw movements significantly decreased as children began producing the voiceless phoneme /p/. A significant negative correlation between the STI and the length of voice onset time ( VOT) was also found in the voiceless productions in 4 of the 6 participants.
Conclusions: Oral articulator movement variability is reduced in children across the stabilization of voicing contrast acquisition. Further, the relationship between VOT contrast production and movement variability suggests that a coordinate system between the oral and laryngeal articulators may be refined as children acquire the voicing contrast.},

Drawing on the generative literature in phonological acquisition, as well as the work of phoneticians and psycholinguists, we offer alternative parsing algorithms and examine their implications for learnability and the initial ranking of Optimality Theory constraints. Finally, we propose that the resolution of the comprehension/production dilemma lies not in the phonological domain (linguistic competence), but in the domain of the implementation of linguistic knowledge (performance).},

Acoustic reduction refers to the phenomenon that, in spontaneous speech, phonemes may be shorter or absent. We review studies investigating effects of the repetition of a morpheme, of whether a segment plays a crucial role in the identification of its morpheme, and of a word's morphological decomposability. We conclude that these studies report either no effects of morphological structure or effects that are open to alternative interpretations. Our analysis also reveals the need for a uniform definition of morphological decomposability. Furthermore, we examine whether the reduction of segments in morphologically complex words correlates with these segments' contribution to the identification of the whole word, and discuss previous studies and new analyses supporting this hypothesis. We conclude that the data show no convincing evidence that morphological structure conditions reduction, which contrasts with the expectations of several models of speech production and of morphological processing (e.g., WEAVER++ and dual-route models). The data collected so far support psycholinguistic models which assume that all morphologically complex words are processed as complete units.},

A perception experiment based on present-day Italian showed that inherently lip-rounded segments were more likely to be masked\textemdash and thereby erroneously deleted\textemdash in hypoarticulated speech. The second experiment tested whether the mismatch between the modalities was more likely in young children than in adults. For this purpose, first language German speakers participated in a forced-choice perception experiment in which they categorised German back and front vowels in coarticulatory non-fronting and fronting consonantal contexts. Children's ability to normalise for coarticulation was shown to be less than that of the adults. Taken together, the results suggest that sound change can occur when coarticulatory relationships are perceptually obscured due to a hypoarticulated speaking style causing consonants to be camouflaged in the case of dissimilation and variants to approximate those that are strongly influenced by coarticulation in the case of diachronic back vowel fronting.},

Twenty-nine L1-German speakers produced minimal pairs differing in vowel tensity in both monosyllables /zakt, za{$\Elzlmrk$}kt/ and disyllables /zakt{$\Elzschwa$}, za{$\Elzlmrk$}kt{$\Elzschwa$}/. The target words were produced in accented and deaccented contexts. The duration ratio between the vowel and the following /kt/ cluster was less for lax than tense vowels and less for disyllables than monosyllables. Under deaccentuation, there was an approximation of tense and lax vowels towards each other but no influence due to the mono- vs. disyllabic difference. On the other hand, Gaussian /a/ vs. /a{$\Elzlmrk$}/ classifications of these data showed a lesser influence due to the syllable count in deaccented words. Compatibly, when the same speakers as listeners classified synthetic sackt-sagt and sackte-sagte continua, they were shown to compensate for the syllable count differences, but to a lesser extent in a deaccented context. Deaccentuation may therefore provide the conditions for sound change to take place by which /a{$\Elzlmrk$}/ shortens in polysyllabic words; it may do so because the association between coarticulation and the source that gives rise to it is hidden to a greater extent than in accented contexts.},

The declarative/procedural model of language, which posits that the lexicon of stored words is part of declarative memory, while grammatical composition of complex forms depends on procedural memory, predicts a female superiority in aspects of lexical memory. Other neurocognitive models of language have not made this prediction. Here we examine the prediction in past-tense over-regularizations (e.g. holded) produced by children. We expected that girls would remember irregular past-tense forms (held) better than boys, and thus would over-regularize less. To our surprise, girls over-regularized far more than boys. We investigated potential explanations for this sex difference. Analyses showed that in girls but not boys, over-regularization rates correlated with measures of the number of similar-sounding regulars (folded, molded). This sex difference in phonological neighborhood effects is taken to suggest that girls tend to produce over-regularizations in associative lexical memory, generalizing over stored neighboring regulars, while boys are more likely to depend upon rule-governed affixation (hold + -ed). The finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, likely due to their superior lexical abilities, females tend to retrieve from memory complex forms (walked) that men generally compose with the grammatical system (walk + -ed). The results suggest that sex may be an important factor in the acquisition and computation of language.},

In the current study, we examined the role of siblings' sex and age gap as moderating factors, reasoning that they affect older siblings' tendency to compensate for reduced parental attention. We hypothesized that children with an older sister have better language abilities than children with an older brother, especially when there is a large age gap between the two siblings. We reanalyzed data from the EDEN cohort (N = 1,154) and found that children with an older sister had better language skills than those with an older brother. Contrary to predictions, results showed that the age gap between siblings was not associated with language skills and did not interact with sex. Results suggest that the negative effect of older siblings on language development may be entirely due to the role of older brothers. Our findings invite further research on the mechanisms involved in this effect.},

  abstract = {Contemporary New Zealand English has distinctive pronunciations of three characteristic vowels. Did the evolution of these distinctive pronunciations occur in all words at the same time or were different words affected differently? We analyze the changing pronunciation of New Zealand English in a large set of recordings of speakers born over a 130 year period. We show that low frequency words were at the forefront of these changes and higher frequency words lagged behind. A long-standing debate exists between authors claiming that high frequency words lead regular sound change and others claiming that there are no frequency effects. The leading role of low frequency words is surprising in this context. It can be elucidated in models of lexical processing that include detailed word-specific memories. \'O 2015 The Authors.

The effects of frequency and density on speech production were examined when phonetic forms were nonreferential (i.e., when no referent was attached) and when phonetic forms were referential (i.e., when a referent was attached through fast mapping). Two methods of analysis were included: kinematic variability of speech movement patterning and measures of segmental accuracy. Results showed that phonotactic frequency influenced the stability of movement patterning whereas neighborhood density influenced phoneme accuracy. Motor learning was observed in both nonreferential and referential novel words. Forms with low phonotactic probability and low neighborhood density showed a word learning effect when a referent was assigned during fast mapping. These results elaborate on and specify the nature of interactivity observed across lexical, phonological, and articulatory domains.},

Ethnolinguistic diversity and inequality, intercultural communication and contact, and global political and economic interdependence are more than ever acknowledged realities of today's world, and all of them put pressures on our educational systems. Now, as throughout history, multilingual education offers the best possibilities for preparing coming generations to participate in constructing more just and democratic societies in our globalized and intercultural world; however, it is not unproblematically achieved. There are many unanswered questions and doubts as to policy and implementation, program and curricular design, classroom instruction practices, pedagogy, and teacher professional development, but there is also much that we understand and know very well, based on empirical research in many corners of the world. Here I highlight Bolivian and other Indigenous educational experiences with which I am most familiar, and which capture certainties that hold beyond the particular instances I describe. My emphasis is on what we know and are sure of, and my goal is to convey my deep conviction that multilingual education constitutes a wide and welcoming educational doorway toward peaceful coexistence of peoples and especially restoration and empowerment of those who have been historically oppressed.},

Limited access to pitch cues is thought to decrease sensitivity to prosody in CI users, but co-occurring changes in intensity and duration may provide redundant cues. The current study investigates how listeners use these cues to infer discourse prominence. CI users and normal-hearing (NH) listeners were presented with sentences varying in prosody (accented vs. unaccented words) while their eye-movements were measured to referents varying in discourse status (given vs. new categories). In Experiment 1, all listeners inferred prominence when prosody on nouns distinguished categories (``SANDAL'' \textrightarrow{} not sandwich). In Experiment 2, CI users and NH listeners presented with natural speech inferred prominence when prosody on adjectives implied contrast across both categories and properties (``PINK horse'' \textrightarrow{} not the orange horse). In contrast, NH listeners presented with simulated CI (vocoded) speech were sensitive to acoustic differences in prosody, but did not use these cues to infer discourse status. Together, this suggests that exploiting redundant cues for comprehension varies with the demands of language processing and prior experience with the degraded signal.},

Measures of mothers' speech at 18 months were examined in relation to children's speech processing efficiency and reported vocabulary at 18 and 24 months. Children of mothers who provided more input at 18 months knew more words and were faster in word recognition at 24 months. Moreover, multiple regression analyses indicated that the influences of caregiver speech on speed of word recognition and vocabulary were largely overlapping. This study provides the first evidence that input shapes children's lexical processing efficiency and that vocabulary growth and increasing facility in spoken word comprehension work together to support the uptake of the information that rich input affords the young language learner.},

The present study is a first investigation of the PE in children. In two experiments we tested five-year-olds in a PE paradigm using pictures of objects as stimuli. In Experiment , pictures of familiar objects were presented to be remembered, and in Experiment  we used pictures of unfamiliar objects (evaluating new vocabulary acquisition). In both experiments we showed a memory advantage for vocally produced words (`look and say') over other types of learning (`look', `look and listen'), suggesting the PE as a prominent memory and learning tool.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Multiple studies have reported healthcare disparities in particular settings and conditions within pediatric otolaryngology, but a systematic examination of the breadth of the problem within the field is lacking. This study's objectives are to synthesize the available evidence regarding healthcare disparities in pediatric otolaryngology, highlight recurrent themes with respect to etiologies and manifestations, and demonstrate potential impacts from patient and provider standpoints.
Methods: A qualitative systematic review of the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases for articles focusing on racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic disparities related to pediatric otolaryngology conditions or settings was conducted. United Statesbased studies of any design or publication date with analysis of children 0 to 18 years old were included.
Results: Of 711 abstracts identified, 39 met inclusion criteria. Manual review of references from these articles yielded 22 additional studies, for a total of 61. Disparities were identified in nearly every subspecialty within pediatric otolaryngology, with otologic conditions the most frequently studied (33 of 61). The most commonly cited disparities involved low socioeconomic status (25 of 61), inadequate insurance (23 of 61), nonwhite race (21 of 61), and barriers to accessing care (21 of 61). Only six articles found no disparities regarding the condition examined in their study.
Conclusion: Through a variety of study topics, designs, and settings, a growing body of literature documents disparities across the spectrum of pediatric otolaryngology care.

Using novel data from a longitudinal corpus of spontaneous child speech in Polish, we evaluate and compare the predictions of a variety of input-based phonotactic models for syllable structure acquisition. We find that many commonly examined input statistics can make dramatically different predictions, as do different assumptions about the representational units over which statistics are calculated. We find that development is sensitive to multiple abstract units of phonological representation, supporting a crucial role for feature-based generalization. We also identify departures between the predictions of the best phonotactic models and children's production patterns that indicate that input sensitivity alone cannot fully explain the developmental patterns. We discuss the role of universal markedness and phonetic difficulty and argue that a full explanation requires reference to these biases.},

Experiment 1 found that Dutch listeners rated [s] and [P] as more similar to each other than American English listeners did. We attributed this to the lack of a phonemic distinction between [s] and [P] in Dutch phonology in addition to their relationship via a productive phonological rule in Dutch. Experiment 1 also found that Dutch listeners rated [y] and [s], and [y] and [P] as more similar to each other than did American English listeners. We attributed this to the lack of [y] in the Dutch inventory. Experiment 2 found that Dutch and American English listeners did not significantly differ from each other in a speeded discrimination task with the same stimuli as Experiment 1. Reaction times in Experiment 2 were highly correlated with the rating data of Experiment 1 indicating that the general pattern of response in Experiment 1 was based on auditory similarity, with language-specific effects superimposed on the general pattern. The auditory basis of distinctive features found here accords with Stevens' (1989) quantal theory account of the feature [ 7 anterior]. We conclude that phonetic similarity is comprised of three components: (1) auditory similarity, (2) phonetic inventory, and (3) language-specific patterns of alternation.},

We overcame this problem by controlling the input to a computational model so that amount of exposure to linguistic input (quantity) and the quality of that input (lexical diversity) were independently manipulated. Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children's data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4). A language input that is rich in lexical diversity outperforms equivalent richness in quantity for learned sublexical and lexical knowledge, for wellestablished language tests, and for acquiring words that have never been encountered before.},

However, it is unclear what processes provide major contributions to NWR performance. This paper presents a computational model of NWR based on Chunking Lexical and Sub-lexical Sequences in Children (CLASSIC) that focuses on the child's exposure to language when learning lexical phonological knowledge. Based on language input aimed at 2\textendash 6 year old children, CLASSIC shows a substantial fit to children's NWR performance for 6 different types of NWR test across 6 different NWR studies that use children of various ages from 2;1 to 6;1. Furthermore, CLASSIC's repetitions of individual nonwords correlate significantly with children's repetitions of the same nonwords, NWR performance shows strong correlations to vocabulary size, and interaction effects seen in the model are consistent with those found in children. Such a fit to the data is achieved without any need for developmental parameters, suggesting that between the ages of two and six years, NWR performance measures the child's current level of linguistic knowledge that arises from their exposure to language over time and their ability to extract lexical phonological knowledge from that exposure.},

  abstract = {Tests of nonword repetition (NWR) have often been used to examine children's phonological knowledge and word learning abilities. However, theories of NWR primarily explain performance either in terms of phonological working memory or longterm knowledge, with little consideration of how these processes interact. One theoretical account that focuses specifically on the interaction between short-term and long-term memory is the chunking hypothesis. Chunking occurs because of repeated exposure to meaningful stimulus items, resulting in the items becoming grouped (or chunked); once chunked, the items can be represented in short-term memory using one chunk rather than one chunk per item. We tested several predictions of the chunking hypothesis by presenting 5\textendash 6-year-old children with three tests of NWR that were either high, medium, or low in wordlikeness. The results did not show strong support for the chunking hypothesis, suggesting that chunking fails to fully explain children's NWR behavior. However, simulations using a computational implementation of chunking (namely CLASSIC, or Chunking Lexical And Sub-lexical Sequences In Children) show that, when the linguistic input to 5\textendash 6-year-old children is estimated in a reasonable way, the children's data are matched across all three NWR tests. These results have three implications for the field: (a) a chunking account can explain key NWR phenomena in 5\textendash 6-year-old children; (b) tests of chunking accounts require a detailed specification both of the chunking mechanism itself and of the input on which the chunking mechanism operates; and (c) verbal theories emphasizing the role of long-term knowledge (such as chunking) are not precise enough to make detailed predictions about experimental data, but computational implementations of the theories can bridge the gap.},

Results indicated that bilinguals who spoke languages characterized by high frequency/complexity of codas and clusters had superior results in their coda and cluster accuracy in comparison to monolinguals. Bilinguals also had better coda and cluster accuracy scores than monolinguals. These findings provide evidence for cross-linguistic interaction in combination with a `general bilingual effect'.

Method: We used a longitudinal design, combining both naturalistic observations and a nonword repetition test. Fifteen 26-month-olds (twelve of whom were followed from age eleven months) were administered a nonword test including real words, ``standard'' nonwords (identical for all children), and nonwords based on individual children's production inventory (IN and OUT words).
Results: A strong relationship was found between (i) length of experience with consonant production and (ii) nonword repetition and between (i) differential experience with specific consonants through production and (ii) performance on the IN vs. OUT words.
Conclusions: Performance depended on familiarity with words or their subunits, and was strongest for real words, weaker for IN words, and weakest for OUT words. Our results demonstrate the important role of speech production in the construction of phonological working memory. [145 words]},

While p-values reflect the probability of incorrectly concluding a null effect is real, they do not provide information about other types of error that are also important for interpreting statistical results. In this paper, we focus on three measures related to these errors. The first, power, reflects the likelihood of detecting an effect that in fact exists. The second and third, Type M and Type S errors, measure the extent to which estimates of the magnitude and direction of an effect are inaccurate. We then provide an example of design analysis (Gelman \& Carlin, 2014), using data from an experimental study on German incomplete neutralization, to illustrate how power, magnitude, and sign errors vary with sample and effect size. This case study shows how the informativity of research findings can vary substantially in ways that are not always, or even usually, apparent on the basis of a p-value alone. We conclude by repeating three recommendations for good statistical practice in phonetics from best practices widely recommended for the social and behavioral sciences: report all results; design studies which will produce high-precision estimates; and conduct direct replications of previous findings.},

Human speech  perception is a perceptual domain where this problem has long been  acknowledged: individual talkers vary substantially in how they produce  linguistic units using acoustic cues.  Yet, how the speech system solves this  problem of talker variability remains poorly understood. This thesis presents  a computational framework---the ideal adapter---for understanding this  problem and how the speech perception system solves it. The basic insight of  this framework is that variability in speech is not arbitrary but rather  structured: talkers are reasonably consistent in the way they produce  cues, and individual talkers tend to cluster into groups by gender,  regional background, etc.  This structure means that listeners can use their  previous experience with other talkers to guide perception of unfamiliar  talkers, as well as familiar talkers that they encounter again. This framework  unifies a large and messy literature on how listeners cope with talker  variability, leads to quantitative models that provide good fits to human  behavior in a variety of situations, and makes specific, testable predictions  that open up new frontiers in understanding speech perception. This framework  also applies to perception in general, and highlights how speech perception  can serve as a model organism for understanding how perceptual systems cope  with a variable but structured world.},

We hypothesize that embedded forms show more phonetic reduction than forms at higher structural levels (`Embedded Reduction Hypothesis'). This paper tests the prediction of the Embedded Reduction Hypothesis with triconstituent compounds. The analysis of the durational properties of almost 500 compound tokens shows that there is a lengthening effect on the non-embedded constituent, and a shortening effect on the adjacent embedded constituent. Yet, this predicted effect of embedding interacts with other lexical factors, above all the bigram frequency of the embedded compound. At a theoretical level, these effects mean that the durational properties of the cross-boundary constituents are indicative of the hierarchical structure and of the strength of the internal boundary of triconstituent compounds. Hence, morphological structure is reflected in the speech signal.},

Infants' acquisition of onomatopoeia is shown to be driven by a preference for structures that are easy to plan and produce.

Research has shown that the emergence of CB precedes first words, predicts language outcomes, and is delayed in infants with several communicative disorders. We seek a naturalistic portrayal of CB development, using all-day home recordings to evaluate the influences of age, language, and social circumstances on infant CB production. Thus we address the nature of very early language foundations and how they can be modulated. This is the first study to evaluate possible interactions of language and social circumstance in the development of babbling. We examined the effects of age (6 and 11 months), language/culture (English and Chinese), and social circumstances (during infant-directed speech [IDS], during infant overhearing of adult-directed speech [ADS], or when infants were alone) on canonical babbling ratios (CBR=canonical syllables/total syllables). The results showed a three-way interaction of infant age by infant language/culture by social circumstance. The complexity of the results forces us to recognize that a variety of factors can interact in the development of foundations for language, and that both the infant vocal response to the language/ culture environment and the language/culture environment of the infant may change across age.},

Evidence of distinctive phonetic categorization in bilingual children was more salient in vowels than in stops. Vowels and stops produced by the bilingual children were not significantly different from those of their monolingual counterparts. The findings suggest that, similar to other language domains, two linguistic systems are apparent in the phonetic production component of three-year-old KEB children, but that phonetic distinctiveness in production may not emerge holistically in an across-the-board fashion, appearing earlier in vowels than stops. Thus, the phonetic production systems of the two languages may develop with only limited interaction in simultaneous KEB children exposed to two languages at an early age.},

These results have been questioned in research failing to find such effects and challenging the positive findings on methodological grounds. We studied English- and Chinese-learning infants at 8, 10, and 12 months and found listeners could not detect ambient-language effects in the vast majority of infant utterances, but only in items deemed to be words or to contain canonical syllables that may have made them sound like words with language-specific shapes. Thus, the present research suggests the earliest ambient-language effects may be found in emerging lexical items or in utterances influenced by language-specific features of lexical items. Even the ambient-language effects for infant canonical syllables and words were very small compared with ambient-language effects for meaningless but phonotactically well-formed syllable sequences spoken by adult native speakers of English and Chinese.},

This first release focuses on Speech Activity Detection, Speaker Diarization, and their evaluation. The present paper introduces the set of included tools and the current workflow, which is focused on making minimal assumptions regarding users' technical skills. Additionally, we show how the current DiViMe tools fare against three sets of challenging data. In a first experiment, we look at performance with samples extracted from daylong recordings gathered using the LENATM system from English-learning children. We find that the performance of the tools currently in DiViMe is not far from that achieved by the LENATM proprietary software. In a second experiment, we generalize to other samples of child-centered daylong files, gathered with non-LENATM hardware from non-English-learning children, showing that performance does not degrade in this condition. Finally, we report on performance in the DiHARD 2018 Challenge Test Data. Originally conceived in the ``Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen'', DiViMe is a promising platform for packaging speech technology tools for widespread re-use, with potential impact on both fundamental and applied speech and language research.},

According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a `module' specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.},

Both English and Japanese have a two-way contrast between an alveolar fricative (/s/), and a postalveolar fricative (/{$\int$}/ in English and /ɕ/ in Japanese). Acoustic analysis of the adult productions revealed cross-linguistic differences in what acoustic parameters were used to differentiate the two fricatives in the two languages and in how well the two fricatives were differentiated by the acoustic parameters that were investigated. For the children's data, the transcription results showed that English-speaking children generally produced the alveolar fricative more accurately than the postalveolar one, whereas the opposite was true for Japanese-speaking children. In addition, acoustic analysis revealed the presence of covert contrast in the productions of some English-speaking and some Japanese-speaking children. The different development patterns are discussed in terms of the differences in the fine phonetic detail of the contrast in the two languages.},

At the same time, evidence of children acquiring knowledge that is richer than the input supports arguments in favor of such mechanisms. This tension can be resolved by separating the inferential and deductive components of the language learning mechanism. Universal Grammar provides representations that support deductions about sentences that fall outside of experience. In addition, these representations define the evidence that learners use to infer a particular grammar. The input is compared with the expected evidence to drive statistical inference. In support of this model, we review evidence of (a) children's sensitivity to the environment, (b) mismatches between input and intake, (c) the need for learning mechanisms beyond innate representations, and (d) the deductive consequences of children's acquired syntactic representations.},

Speakers can, and typically do, tune their performance according to communicative and situational demands, controlling the interplay between production-oriented factors on the one hand, and output-oriented constraints on the other. For the ideal speaker, H\&H claims that such adaptations reflect his tacit awareness of the listener's access to sources of information independent of the signal and his judgement of the short-term demands for explicit signal information. Hence speakers are expected to vary their output along a continuum of hyper- and hypospeech. The theory suggests that the lack of invariance that speech signals commonly exhibit (Perkell and Klatt 1986) is a direct consequence of this adaptive organization (cf MacNeilage 1970). Accordingly, in the H\&H program the quest for phonetic invariance is replaced by another research task: Explicating the notion of sufficient discriminability and defining the class of speech signals that meet that criterion.},

A role for infant vocalizations produced endogenously, potentially providing raw material for interaction and a basis for growth in the vocal capacity itself, has received less attention. We report that in laboratory recordings of infants and their parents, the bulk of infant speech-like vocalizations, or "protophones", were directed toward no one and instead appeared to be generated endogenously, mostly in exploration of vocal abilities. The tendency to predominantly produce protophones without directing them to others occurred both during periods when parents were instructed to interact with their infants and during periods when parents were occupied with an interviewer, with the infants in the room. The results emphasize the infant as an agent in vocal learning, even when not interacting socially and suggest an enhanced perspective on foundations for vocal language.},

This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

Their response patterns changed systematically wi th the nature. of the context. In Experiment 3, the subjects listened first to pairs of isolated noises immediately followed by the same noises in context. When, subsequently, only noises in context were presented for discrimination, most of the subjects performed noncategorically and were no longer influenced by different vocalic contexts.

In this study of 3-year-old Spanish-English bilinguals (n = 18), traditional parent-report estimates of exposure were compared to measures of the number of Spanish and English words children heard during naturalistic audio recordings. While the two estimates were moderately correlated, observed numbers of child-directed words were more consistently predictive of children's processing speed and standardized test performance, even when controlling for reported proportion of exposure.

It is typically assumed that this developmental change reflects the construction of language-specific phoneme categories, but how these categories are learned largely remains a mystery. Peperkamp, Le Calvez, Nadal, and Dupoux (2006) present an algorithm that can discover phonemes using the distributions of allophones as well as the phonetic properties of the allophones and their contexts. We show that a third type of information source, the occurrence of pairs of minimally differing word forms in speech heard by the infant, is also useful for learning phonemic categories and is in fact more reliable than purely distributional information in data containing a large number of allophones. In our model, learners build an approximation of the lexicon consisting of the high-frequency n-grams present in their speech input, allowing them to take advantage of top-down lexical information without needing to learn words. This may explain how infants have already begun to exhibit sensitivity to phonemic categories before they have a large receptive lexicon.},

It is widely thought that caregivers facilitate this task by hyperarticulating when speaking to their infants. Using state-of-the-art speech technology, we addressed this key theoretical question: Are sound categories clearer in infant-directed speech than in adult-directed speech? A comprehensive examination of sound contrasts in a large corpus of recorded, spontaneous Japanese speech demonstrates that there is a small but significant tendency for contrasts in infant-directed speech to be less clear than those in adult-directed speech. This finding runs contrary to the idea that caregivers actively enhance phonetic categories in infant-directed speech. These results suggest that to be plausible, theories of infants' language acquisition must posit an ability to learn from noisy data.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes how others engage rural and urban Mozambican infants during naturalistic observations, and how the proportion of time spent in different engagements relates to infants' language development over the second year of life. Using an extended version of Bakeman and Adamson's (1984) categorization of infant engagement, we investigated to what extent a detailed analysis of infant engagement can contribute to our understanding of vocabulary development in natural settings. In addition, we explored how the different infant engagements relate to vocabulary size, and how these differ between both communities. Results show that rural infants spend significantly more time in forms of solitary engagement, whereas urban infants spend more time in forms of triadic joint engagement. In regard to correlations with reported productive vocabulary, we find that dyadic Persons engagement (i.e. interactions not about concrete objects) has positive correlations with vocabulary measures in both rural and urban communities. In addition, we find that triadic Coordinated Joint Attention has a positive relationship with vocabulary in the urban community, but a contrasting negative correlation with vocabulary in the rural community. These similarities and differences are explained based upon the parenting beliefs and socialization practices of different prototypical learning environments. Overall, this study concludes that the extended categorization provides a valuable contribution to the analysis of infant engagement and their relation to language acquisition, especially for analyzing naturalistic observations as compared to semi-structured studies. Moreover, with respect to vocabulary development, Mozambican infants appear to benefit strongest from dyadic Persons engagement, while they do not necessarily benefit from joint attention, as tends to be the case for children from industrial, developed communities.},

In Study 1, we show that errors of omission occur until the age of 7 and are more likely with both sibilant regular nouns (e.g., dress) and irregular nouns (e.g., man) than regular nouns (e.g., dog). Sibilant nouns are more likely to be inflected if they are high frequency. In Studies 2 and 3, we show that similar effects apply to the inflection of verbs and that there is an advantage for ``regular-like'' irregulars whose inflected form, but not stem form, ends in d/t. The results imply that (a) stems and inflected forms compete for production and (b) children generalize both product-oriented and source-oriented schemas when learning about inflectional morphology.},

  abstract = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge This study tests the hypothesis that the relative timing, or coarticulation, of articulatory movements at VC and CV boundaries is influenced by both the listener's requirement for clarity and the speaker's strategy to economize effort. Movement and acoustic data were collected from 7 subjects who spoke in three conditions: normal, clear, and fast. It was predicted that fast speech would show more coarticulation and clear speech would show less coarticulation than normal speech. The speech materials were designed to investigate coarticulation in the movements of the upper lip and tongue. They consisted of repetitions of [iCnu] utterances embedded in carrier phrases, where the number of consonants, n, ranged from 1 to 3. Analyses focused on kinematic measures and the amount of coarticulation (overlap) of the /i-u/ transition movement with the acoustic interval of the /i/. The consonant-string duration was longest in the clear speaking condition and shortest in the fast condition. Compared to the normal condition, peak velocities were higher in the fast and clear speaking conditions, indicating increased effort. The influences of speaking condition on coarticulation and on the formants of the /i/ were small. Thus, even though there was evidence of increased effort in the clear and fast conditions, the hypothesized effects of a trade-off between clarity and economy of effort were minimally evident in formant values for /i/ and measures of coarticulation.},

However, definitive evidence of a mechanism to explain these developmental changes in speech perception has remained elusive. The present study provides the first evidence for such a mechanism, showing that the statistical distribution of phonetic variation in the speech signal influences whether 6- and 8-month-old infants discriminate a pair of speech sounds. We familiarized infants with speech sounds from a phonetic continuum, exhibiting either a bimodal or unimodal frequency distribution. During the test phase, only infants in the bimodal condition discriminated tokens from the endpoints of the continuum. These results demonstrate that infants are sensitive to the statistical distribution of speech sounds in the input language, and that this sensitivity influences speech perception. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Participants were two children who produced a perceptually overt velar-alveolar contrast and two children who neutralised the contrast via velar fronting.

One child with velar fronting demonstrated covert contrast in one acoustic and one ultrasound measure; the other showed no evidence of contrast. Clinical implications are discussed in this article.},

Aggregated ratings have been found to correlate strongly with acoustic gold standard measures both when individual raters use a continuous rating scale such as visual analog scaling () and when individual raters provide binary ratings (). In light of evidence that inexperienced listeners use continuous scales less consistently than experienced listeners, this study investigated the relative merits of binary versus continuous rating scales when aggregating responses over large numbers of naive listeners recruited through online crowdsourcing. Stimuli were words produced by children in treatment for misarticulation of North American English /r/. Each listener rated the same 40 tokens two times: once using Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) and once using a binary rating scale. The gradient rhoticity of each item was then estimated using (a) VAS click location, averaged across raters; (b) the proportion of raters who assigned the ``correct /r/'' label to each item in the binary rating task ({\^p}). First, we validate these two measures of rhoticity against each other and against an acoustic gold standard. Second, we explore the range of variability in individual response patterns that underlie these group-level data. Third, we integrate statistical, theoretical, and practical considerations to offer guidelines for determining which measure to use in a given situation.},

  abstract = {It is known that some adult listeners have more sharply defined perceptual categories than others, and listeners with more precise auditory targets are also more precise in their production of contrasts. There is additionally evidence that children who have not yet mastered production of a contrast show diminished performance on perceptual measures of the same contrast. To date, however, few studies have investigated developmental perception-production relations using the fine-grained measures typical of adult studies. Existing evidence suggests that perception and production can be closely connected in development, but this relationship may break down as perception and articulation mature at different rates. This study evaluated perception and production of the English /r-w/ contrast in 40 typically-developing children aged 9\textendash 14. Perceptual sensitivity was measured with a logistic function fitted over responses in a forced-choice identification task using two synthetic 10-step continua from rake to wake. Participants also produced rhotic and non-rhotic words. Across participants, there was a significant correlation between perceptual acuity and rhoticity in production, although this effect was only observed for one of two continua tested. These results provide preliminary evidence compatible with the hypothesis that children with a more refined auditory target for a sound also produce that sound more accurately.

Children have difficulty executing discrete tongue movements, preferring to move the tongue and jaw as a single unit. This predisposes the child to produce undifferentiated linguopalatal contact, neutralizing the coronal\textendash velar contrast. Adopting a phonetically sensitive model of phonology, I propose that children's difficulty with discrete tongue movement can be encoded in a violable constraint, MOVE-AS-UNIT. The positional nature of fronting reflects the fact that discrete lingual movement is penalized more heavily in the motorically challenging context of a larger gesture. This analysis is supported with a longitudinal study of one child (3 ; 9 to 4; 4) whose fronting was conditioned by both segmental and prosodic factors. Adopting MOVE-AS-UNIT in a Harmonic Grammar framework makes it possible to reframe disparate-seeming conditioning factors as a unified grammatical system.},

Because of limited progress in the first cohort, a series of two closely related studies was conducted in place of a single study. The studies differed primarily in the nature of tongue-shape targets (e.g., retroflex, bunched) cued during treatment.
Method\textemdash Eight participants received 8 weeks of individual ultrasound biofeedback treatment targeting rhotics. In Study 1, all 4 participants were cued to match a bunched tongue-shape target. In Study 2, participants received individualized cues aimed at eliciting the tongue shape most facilitative of perceptually correct rhotics.
Results\textemdash Participants in Study 1 showed only minimal treatment effects. In Study 2, all participants demonstrated improved production of rhotics in untreated words produced without biofeedback, with large to very large effect sizes.
Conclusions\textemdash The results of Study 2 indicate that with proper parameters of treatment, ultrasound biofeedback can be a highly effective intervention for children with persistent rhotic errors. In addition, qualitative comparison of Studies 1 and 2 suggests that treatment for the North American English rhotic should include opportunities to explore different tongue shapes, to find the most facilitative variant for each individual speaker.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              This study was designed to test the incremental validity of more expensive vocal development variables relative to less expensive variables for predicting later expressive language in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We devote particular attention to the added value of coding the quality of vocalizations over the quantity of vocalizations because coding quality adds expense to the coding process. We are also interested in the added value of more costly human-coded vocal variables relative to those generated through automated analyses.
            
            
              Method
              Eighty-seven children with ASD aged 13\textendash 30 months at study initiation participated. For quantity of vocalizations, we derived one variable from human coding of brief communication samples and one from an automated process for daylong naturalistic audio samples. For quality of vocalizations, we derived four human-coded variables and one automated variable. A composite expressive language measure was derived at study entry, and 6 and 12 months later. The 12 months\textendash centered intercept of a simple linear growth trajectory was used to quantify later expressive language.
            
            
              Results
              When statistically controlling for human-coded or automated quantity of vocalization variables, human-coded quality of vocalization variables exhibited incremental validity for predicting later expressive language skills. Human-coded vocal variables also predicted later expressive language skills when controlling for the analogous automated vocal variables.
            
            
              Conclusion
              In sum, these findings support devoting resources to human coding of the quality of vocalizations from communication samples to predict later expressive language skills in young children with ASD despite the greater costs of deriving these variables.

Theories of the developmental steps that pave the way for word production have proposed that either vocal or gestural precursors are key. These accounts were tested by assessing the developmental synchrony in the onset of babbling, pointing and word production for 46 infants observed monthly between the ages of 9 and 18 months. Babbling and pointing did not develop in tight synchrony and babble onset alone predicted first words. Pointing and maternal education emerged as predictors of lexical knowledge only in relation to a measure taken at 18months. This suggests a far more important role for early phonological development in the creation of the lexicon than previously thought.},

Results\textemdash Within-subject formant frequency variability remained relatively constant for the span of ages studied here. It was often difficult to detect overall decreases in the first two formant frequencies between the ages of 30 and 48 months. A study of the movement of the corner vowels with respect to the vowel centroid showed that the shape of the vowel space remained qualitatively constant from 30 through 48 months.
Conclusions\textemdash The shape of the vowel space is established early in life. Some aspects of regional dialect were observed in some of the subjects at 42 months of age. The present paper adds to the existing data on the development of vowel spaces by describing ecologically realistic speech.},

  abstract = {Infant directed speech (IDS) is a speech register characterized by simpler sentences, a slower rate, and more variable prosody. Recent work has implicated it in more subtle aspects of language development. Kuhl et al. (1997) demonstrated that segmental cues for vowels are affected by IDS in a way that may enhance development: the average locations of the extreme ``point'' vowels (/ a/, /i/ and /u/) are further apart in acoustic space. If infants learn speech categories, in part, from the statistical distributions of such cues, these changes may specifically enhance speech category learning. We revisited this by asking (1) if these findings extend to a new cue (Voice Onset Time, a cue for voicing); (2) whether they extend to the interior vowels which are much harder to learn and/or discriminate; and (3) whether these changes may be an unintended phonetic consequence of factors like speaking rate or prosodic changes associated with IDS. Eighteen caregivers were recorded reading a picture book including minimal pairs for voicing (e.g., beach/peach) and a variety of vowels to either an adult or their infant. Acoustic measurements suggested that VOT was different in IDS, but not in a way that necessarily supports better development, and that these changes are almost entirely due to slower rate of speech of IDS. Measurements of the vowel suggested that in addition to changes in the mean, there was also an increase in variance, and statistical modeling suggests that this may counteract the benefit of any expansion of the vowel space. As a whole this suggests that changes in segmental cues associated with IDS may be an unintended by-product of the slower rate of speech and different prosodic structure, and do not necessarily derive from a motivation to enhance development.},

However, a number of studies suggest that even after infancy, children's categories become more categorical and well-defined through about age 12. We investigated the cognitive changes that may be responsible for such development using a visual world paradigm experiment based on (McMurray, Tanenhaus, \& Aslin, 2002). Children from three age groups (7\textendash 8, 12\textendash 13, and 17\textendash 18 years) heard a token from either a b/p or s/{$\Elzesh$} continua spanning two words (beach/peach, ship/sip), and selected its referent from a screen containing four pictures of potential lexical candidates. Eye-movements to each object were monitored as a measure of how strongly children were committing to each candidate as perception unfolds in real-time. Results showed an ongoing sharpening of speech categories through 18, which was particularly apparent during the early stages of real-time perception. When analysis targeted to specifically within-category sensitivity to continuous detail, children exhibited increasingly gradient categories over development, suggesting that increasing sensitivity to finegrained detail in the signal enables these more discrete categorization. Together these suggest that speech development is a protracted process in which children's increasing sensitivity to withincategory detail in the signal enables increasingly sharp phonetic categories.},

In this study, the authors explored whether increased syllable number or segmental factors best explains poorer performance with syllabic plurals. Method: An elicited imitation experiment was conducted with 14 two-year-olds involving 8 familiar disyllabic target plural nouns, half with syllabic plurals (e.g., bus \`a buses) and half with segmental plurals (e.g., letter \`a letters). Children saw pictures of the target items on a computer and repeated prerecorded 3-word-utterances with the target word in utterance-medial position (e.g., ``The buses come'') and utterance-final position (e.g., ``Hear the buses''). Acoustic analysis determined the presence or absence of the plural morpheme and its duration. Results: Children had more trouble producing syllabic plurals compared with segmental plurals. Errors were especially evident in the utterance-medial position, where there was less time for the child to perceive/produce the word in the absence of phrase-final lengthening and where planning for the following word was still required. Conclusions: The results suggested that articulatory difficulties\textemdash rather than a word length effect\textemdash explain later acquisition of syllabic plurals relative to segmental plurals. These findings have implications for the nature of syllabic plural acquisition in children with hearing impairments and specific language impairment.},

This study investigated whether increased utterance length (hence, increased grammatical complexity) adversely affects children's third person singular -s production in more controlled experimental conditions. Method: An elicited imitation task with 12 Australian English\textendash speaking children ages 2;9 (years;months) to 3;2 (Mage = 2;11) was conducted comparing third person singular -s production in 3-word and 5-word utterances, both utterance medially (e.g., He sits back; He sits back and swings) and utterance finally (e.g., There he sits; That's the way he sits) using a within-subjects design. Children were shown pictorial representations of each utterance on a computer and were invited to repeat 16 pseudorandomized prerecorded utterances. Acoustic analysis determined the presence/absence and duration of the third person singular morpheme. Results: Third person singular production was significantly lower utterance medially compared to utterance finally for the 5-word utterances and significantly lower utterance medially in the 5-word compared to 3-word utterances. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased utterance length results in significantly lower third person singular production, but only in the more articulatorily challenging utterance-medial position. Thus, morpheme omission is greatest at the intersection of grammatical and phonological complexity.},

The power of the EAR lies in unobtrusively collecting authentic reallife observational data. In preserving a high degree of naturalism at the level of the raw recordings, it resembles ethnographic methods; through its sampling and coding, it enables larger empirical studies.

Data were taken from a database of ten French vowels uttered by 15 speakers ranging in age from 3 years old to adulthood. Despite the important acoustic variation encountered, one feature is displayed by all the speakers: the production of extreme focal vowels /i/, /u/, /]/, and /y/, realized with a strong concentration of spectral energy related to the proximity of two formant peaks. This feature represents an acoustic goal guiding the speaker's task. Our simulations using an articulatory model demonstrate that the realization of the focalization feature may require different articulatory gestures for young children compared to adults, consisting of adaptive articulatory strategies exploited to compensate for the small pharynx of the former. Perceptual tests show that achieving focalization results in a lower intelligibility for the children than for the adults. Due to the relatively shorter pharyngeal cavity of the child compared to the adult, focalization cannot be achieved together with the perceptual objective related to rounded vowels /y/ in French. Results are discussed in light of the dispersionfocalization theory and the perception for action control theory (PACT).},

The origins of linguistic productivity have been a subject of heated debate: While generativist accounts posit that children's early language reflects the presence of syntactic abstractions, constructivist approaches instead emphasize gradual generalization over frequently-heard forms. Here we develop a Bayesian statistical model that measures the degree of abstraction implicit in children's early use of the determiners ``a'' and ``the.'' Our work reveals that many previously-used corpora are too small to adjudicate between these theoretical positions. Several datasets, including the Speechome Corpus\textemdash a new ultra-dense dataset for one child\textemdash show evidence of low initial levels of productivity and higher levels later in development, however. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that children lack rich grammatical knowledge at the outset of language learning, but rapidly begin to generalize on the basis of structural regularities in their input.},

Zipf in 1935, is a classic empirical law that holds across a wide range of human languages. We demonstrate that length is one aspect of a much more general property of words: how distinctive they are with respect to other words in a language. Distinctiveness plays a critical role in recognizing words in fluent speech, in that it reflects the strength of potential competitors when selecting the best candidate for an ambiguous signal. Phonological information content, a measure of a word's string probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. Examining largescale corpora from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word length as a predictor of frequency. This finding provides evidence that listeners' processing constraints shape fine-grained aspects of word forms across languages.},

  abstract = {Polysynthetic languages can present special extraction puzzles to children, due to the length of their words. A number of hypotheses concerning children's strategies for acquiring morphology, originally proposed on the basis of their approaches to somewhat simpler systems, are confirmed by observations of five children acquiring Mohawk. Among the Mohawk children, the earliest segmentation of words was phonological rather than morphological: stressed syllables, usually penultimate or antepenultimate, were extracted first. Ultimate syllables were then added, confirming the salience of the ends of words. During this time, distinctions expressed by adults in affixes were either omitted or expressed analytically. Acquisition then moved leftward by syllables. When most utterances were long enough to include pronominal prefixes as well as roots, morphological structure was apparently discovered. It is not surprising that the pronouns should trigger this awareness, since they are frequent, appearing with every verb and most nouns, they are functional, and they are semantically transparent. From this point on, the children acquired affixes primarily according to their utility and semantic transparency rather than their phonological shape or position.},

We introduce a model of the cognitive architecture of a communicating agent, called COSMO (for ``Communicating about Objects using Sensory\textendash Motor Operations') that allows a probabilistic expression of the main theoretical trends found in the speech production and perception literature. This enables a computational comparison of these theoretical trends, which helps us to identify the conditions that favor the emergence of linguistic codes. We present realistic simulations of phonological system emergence showing that COSMO is able to predict the main regularities in vowel, stop consonant and syllable systems in human languages.},

We investigated this issue using Ultrasound Tongue Imaging in the context of an experimental cognitive psychology paradigm. Scottish speakers were trained on apparently homophonous monomorphemic and bimorphemic novel words (e.g. zord, zorred), and tested on speech production tasks. Monomorphemic items were realised acoustically with shorter durations than bimorphemic items; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Progressive coarticulatory effects were also observed in the monomorphemic condition for some speakers. A dynamic analysis of the articulatory data revealed that the observed differences in the pronunciations of the two types of items could be due to factors other than morphological structure. Our results, albeit inconclusive, make a significant contribution to the literature in this research domain insofar as the presence or absence of morphological effects on pronunciation has important implications for extant theories of speech production.},

The current study examined the effect of phonological pattern frequency on the fluency and flexibility of speech production. Normal- and fastrate nonsense-word repetitions of three groups of participants (preschool children, school-aged children, and adults) were analyzed. Subjective ratings of the wordlikeness of nonsense words, percentage phonemes correctly repeated, mean duration, and durational variability were measured. In the first experiment, ratings of the wordlikeness of nonsense words were found to correlate with the pattern frequency of sequences embedded in them. In the second analysis, it was found that children, but not adults, repeated infrequent sequences of phonemes less accurately than frequent sequences. In the third experiment, infrequent sequences were produced with longer durations than frequent ones, with children demonstrating a larger difference between frequent and infrequent sequences than adults. Phonological pattern frequency also influenced variability in duration: infrequent sequences of sounds were more variable than frequent ones. Thus, there appears to be an influence of phonological pattern frequency on speech, and, for some measures, a larger effect size is noted for children.},

This study extends this research in 2 ways. First, it compares nonword repetitions by 40 young children with phonological disorders with those by 40 same-age peers with typical phonological development on a nonword repetition task in which the frequency of embedded diphone sequences was varied. Second, it examines the relationship between the frequency effect in the nonword repetition task and other measures of linguistic ability in these children. Children in both groups repeated low-frequency sequences less accurately than high-frequency sequences. The children with phonological disorders were less accurate overall but showed no larger disadvantage for the low-frequency sequences than their age peers. Across the group, the size of the frequency effect was correlated with vocabulary size, but it was independent of measures of speech perception and articulatory ability. These results support the hypothesis that the production difficulty associated with lowfrequency sequences is related primarily to vocabulary growth rather than to developments in articulatory or perceptual ability. By contrast, production problems experienced by children with phonological disorders do not appear to result from difficulties in making abstractions over known lexical items. Instead, they may be associated with difficulties in building representations in the primary sensory and motor domains.},

Specifically, it measured the influence of age, phonetic context, and syllabic context on variability. Spectral variability was estimated by measuring dynamic spectral characteristics of multiple productions of /s/ in sV, spV, and swV sequences, where the vowel was either /a/ or /u/. Mean duration, variability in duration, and coarticulation were also measured. Children were found to produce /s/ with greater temporal and spectral variability than adults. Duration and coarticulation were comparable across the 4 age groups. Spectral variability was greater in swV contexts than in sV or spV sequences. The lack of consistent effects of phonetic context on spectral variability suggests that the developmental differences were related to subtle variability in place of articulation for /s/ in the children's productions.},

However, less is known about the factors that might influence this advantage. This paper reports an investigation of two factors: phonotactic probability and phonological neighborhood density.
Method: Acquisition of fifteen novel words varying in phonotactic probability and phonological neighborhood density was examined in high proficiency, early onset, MandarinEnglish bilinguals and English monolinguals.
Results: Both bilinguals and monolinguals demonstrated a significant effect of phonotactic probability and phonological neighborhood density. Novel word learning improved when the phonological neighborhood density was higher, in contrast, higher phonotactic probability resulted in worse learning. Although, the bilingual speakers showed significantly better novel word learning than monolingual speakers, this did not interact with phonotactic probability and phonological neighbourhood density manipulations.
Conclusion: Both bilingual and monolingual word learning abilities are constrained by the same learning mechanisms. However, bilingual advantages may be underpinned by more effective allocation of cognitive resources due to their dual language experience.},

This paper also clarifies that reduction in the spectral space leads to reduction in phoneme recognition accuracy. This result indicates that spectral reduction is one major reason for the decrease of recognition accuracy in spontaneous speech.},

However, it is unknown whether infants use statistical information to construct a receptive lexicon when acquiring their native language. In order to investigate this issue, we rely on the fact that besides real words a statistical algorithm extracts sound sequences that are highly frequent in infant-directed speech but constitute nonwords. In three experiments, we use a preferential listening paradigm to test French-learning 11-month-old infants' recognition of highly frequent disyllabic sequences from their native language. In Experiments 1 and 2, we use nonword stimuli and find that infants listen longer to high-frequency than to low-frequency sequences. In Experiment 3, we compare high-frequency nonwords to real words in the same frequency range, and find that infants show no preference. Thus, at 11 months, French-learning infants recognize highly frequent sound sequences from their native language and fail to differentiate between words and nonwords among these sequences. These results are evidence that they have used statistical information to extract word candidates from their input and stored them in a `protolexicon', containing both words and nonwords.},

Adaptation to the interlocutor has been shown to take many forms and to embrace all the levels of spoken language, from adjustments in vocal intensity to changes in word forms over the course of a conversational exchange, as well as lexical and syntactic alignment across speakers, to name but a few examples. Phonetic convergence, that is, the tendency for two speakers engaged in a conversational exchange to sound more like each other, is one important aspect of between-speaker adaptation. Empirical evidence has recently accumulated that shows that phonetic convergence is a recurrent phenomenon in mature speakers. This phenomenon relies on sensory-motor abilities that infants may already possess at birth. Phonetic convergence affects the way in which both speakers speak after their interaction has ended, and may build up over long periods of time. It may also be a driving mechanism in the acquisition of the phonology and phonetics of a second language.},

In particular, the involvement of planning and/or programming of speech movements in context was tested by analysing coarticulatory cohesion. For this purpose, second formant frequency measurements were conducted in repetitions of nonsense utterances ([@CV ] C=/s,x,b,d/; V=/i,a,u/), and compared across nine children with DAS, six normally speaking (NS) children and six adult women. The results showed both intra- and intersyllabic anticipatory coarticulation in NS children and adult women, in which the intersyllabic coarticulation was stronger in NS children than in adult women. The children with DAS showed more variability as compared to NS children, made, on average, less distinction between the vowels, and showed individually idiosyncratic coarticulation patterns. These results are discussed in the light of a delay as well as a deviance of speech development in children with DAS.},

We investigated the acoustic structure of syllables produced by young children and adults. Fricative- vowel syllables spoken by 40 subjects (eight adults and eight children at each of the ages 3, 4, 5, and 7 years) were analyzed acoustically to determine how well different syllables-initial fricatives were contrasted and how strongly they were affected by vocalic context. Results indicated two independent developmental trends: The extent to which speakers differentiated between /J'/and /s/ increased with age, while the extent to which they coarticulated each fricative with its following vowel decreased. The
results support the hypothesis that children initially organize and only gradually differentiate the syllable into patterns components.},

Before the availability of cochlear implants, however, that goal was often unattainable, leaving these children to face lifetimes of greatly diminished capabilities. When the first generation of implants became available, dramatic improvements were immediately realized in these children's abilities to acquire spoken language and literacy: about half of the deaf children who received cochlear implants began demonstrating performance on a variety of language and literacy skills within the typical range, defined as better than one standard deviation below the means of children with normal hearing. But as promising as those early outcomes were, it does not appear that these performance levels have changed proportionately with changes in implant technology. This chapter reviews relevant research using standardized measures of spoken language to examine the veracity of that impression, and describes findings across a wide range of studies that explored the linguistic and cognitive mechanisms underlying those standardized measures.},

Children in the control and OME groups participated in additional tasks examining verbal working memory, sentence comprehension, and temporal processing. The temporal-processing task tested the hypothesis that any deficits observed on the language-related tasks could be explained by temporal-processing deficits. Children in the three experimental groups demonstrated similar results to each other, but different from the control group for speech perception and phonological awareness. Children in the OME group differed from those in the control group on tasks involving verbal working memory and sentence comprehension, but not temporal processing. Overall these results supported the major hypothesis explored, but failed to support the hypothesis that language problems are explained to any extent by temporal-processing problems.},

However, the extent to which knowledge of phonemic units may interact with spoken language organization in (transparent) alphabetical languages has hardly been investigated. The present study examined whether phonemic awareness correlates with coarticulation degree, commonly used as a metric for estimating the size of children's production units. A speech production task was designed to test for developmental differences in intra-syllabic coarticulation degree in 41 German children from 4 to 7 years of age. The technique of ultrasound imaging allowed for comparing the articulatory foundations of children's coarticulatory patterns. Four behavioral tasks assessing various levels of phonological awareness from large to small units and expressive vocabulary were also administered. Generalized additive modeling revealed strong interactions between children's vocabulary and phonological awareness with coarticulatory patterns. Greater knowledge of sub-lexical units was associated with lower intra-syllabic coarticulation degree and greater differentiation of articulatory gestures for individual segments. This interaction was mostly nonlinear: an increase in children's phonological proficiency was not systematically associated with an equivalent change in coarticulation degree. Similar findings were drawn between vocabulary and coarticulatory patterns. Overall, results suggest that the process of developing spoken language fluency involves dynamical interactions between cognitive and speech motor domains. Arguments for an integrated-interactive approach to skill development are discussed.},

the possibility that the very early bilingual experience of infancy may
 

affect the unfolding of vocal precursors to speech. The results of 

longitudinal research with 73 infants aged 0;4 to 1;6 in monolingual and
 

bilingual environments provided no support for either a bilingual deficit
 

hypothesis nor for its opposite, a bilingual advantage hypothesis. Infants
 

reared in bilingual and monolingual environments manifested similar 

ages of onset for canonical babbling (production of well-formed 

syllables), an event known to be fundamentally related to speech 

development. Further, quantitative measures of vocal performance 

(proportion of usage of well-formed syllables and vowel-like sounds) 

showed additional similarities between monolingual and bilingual 

infants. The similarities applied to infants of middle and low socio-economic
 

status and to infants that were born at term or prematurely. 

The results suggest that vocal development in the first year of life is
 

robust with respect to conditions of rearing. The biological foundations
 

of speech appear to be such as to resist modifications in the natural 

schedule of vocal development.},

For instance, switching between languages requires the phonological translation of proper names, a skill that requires mapping the phonemic units of one language onto the phonemic units of the other. Proficiency of phonological awareness has been linked to reading success, but little information is available about phonological awareness across multiple phonologies. Furthermore, the relationship between this kind of phonological awareness and reading has never been addressed. The current study investigated phonological translation using a task designed to measure children's ability to map one phonological system onto another. A total of 425 kindergarten and second grade monolingual and bilingual students were evaluated. The results suggest that monolinguals generally performed poorly. Bilinguals translated real names more accurately than fictitious names, in both directions. Correlations between phonological translation and measures of reading ability were moderate, but reliable. Phonological translation is proposed as a tool with which to evaluate phonological awareness through the perspective of children who live with two languages and two attendant phonemic systems.},

At the same time, premature infants show a tendency to produce well-formed syllables less consistently than full terms after the point at which parents and laboratory personnel note the onset of the canonical babbling stage (the point after which well-formed syllables are well established in the infant vocal repertoires). Further, even though low SES infants produce well-formed speech-like structures on schedule, they show a reliably lower tendency to vocalize in general, as reflected by fewer utterances per minute in recorded samples.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the utility of the Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) recording system for investigating the language input to bilingual infants.
Method: Twenty-one French-English bilingual families with a 10-month-old infant participated in this study. Using the LENA recording system, each family contributed three full days of recordings within a one-month period. A portion of these recordings (945 minutes) were manually transcribed, and the word counts from these transcriptions were compared against the LENAgenerated adult word counts.
Results: Data analyses reveal that the LENA algorithms were reliable in counting words in both Canadian English and Canadian French, even when both languages are present in the same recording. While the LENA system tended to underestimate the amount of speech in the recordings, there was a strong correlation between the LENA-generated and human transcribed adult word counts for each language. Importantly, this relationship holds when accounting for different-gendered and different-accented speech.
Conclusions: The LENA recording system is a reliable tool for estimating word counts, even for bilingual input. Special considerations and limitations for using the LENA recording system in a bilingual population are discussed. These results open up possibilities for investigating caregiver talk to bilingual infants in more detail.},

  abstract = {Examining how bilingual infants experience their dual language input is important for understanding bilingual language acquisition. To assess these language experiences, researchers typically conduct language interviews with caregivers. However, little is known about the reliability of these parent reports in describing how bilingual children actually experience dual language input. Here, we explored the quantitative nature of dual language input to bilingual infants. Furthermore, we described some of the heterogeneity of bilingual exposure in a sample of French\textendash English bilingual families. Participants were 21 families with a 10-month-old infant residing in Montr\'eal, Canada. First, we conducted language interviews with the caregivers. Then, each family completed three full-day recordings at home using the Language Environment Analysis recording system. Results showed that children's proportion exposure to each language was consistent across the two measurement approaches, indicating that parent reports are reliable for assessing a bilingual child's language experiences. Further exploratory analyses revealed three unique findings: (a) there can be considerable variability in the absolute amount of input among infants hearing the same proportion of input, (b) infants can hear different proportions of language input when considering infant-directed versus overheard speech, (c) proportion of language input can vary by day, depending on who is caring for the infant. We conclude that collecting naturalistic recordings is complementary to parent-report measures for assessing infant's language experiences and for establishing bilingual profiles.},

Finally, we review interventions that target these three pathways with an eye toward best practice.

Method: The author presents a limited overview of some important developments and discoveries. The perspective is based largely on the research interests of the Speech Motor Control Group (SMCG) within the SCG; thus, it is selective, focusing on normal motor control of the vocal tract in the production of sound segments and syllables. It also covers the particular theories and models that drove the research. Following a brief introduction, there are sections on methodological advances, scientific advances, and conclusions. Results: Scientific and methodological advances have been closely interrelated. Advances in instrumentation and computer hardware and software have made it possible to record and process increasingly large, multifaceted data sets; introduce new paradigms for feedback perturbation; image brain activity; and develop more sophisticated, computational physiological and neural models. Such approaches have led to increased understanding of the widespread variability in speech, motor-equivalent trading relations, sensory goals, and the nature of feedback and feedforward neural control mechanisms. Conclusions: Some ideas about important future directions for speech research are presented.},

In experiment 1, 96 participants aged 9\textendash 14 years carried out an interactive task when communication was easy (no barrier, `NB') and difficult (the speech of one participant was filtered through a vocoder, `VOC'). Previous recordings from 20 adults were used as reference. Measures of VSA (ERB2), F1 and F2 ranges (ERB) and articulation rate were obtained. Children's VSA were significantly larger than adults'. From the age of 11, vowel hyperarticulation was evident in VOC, but only because VSA were gradually reducing with age in NB. The results suggest that whilst large VSA do not prevent children from hyperarticulating vowels, the manner in which this is achieved may not be adult-like. Experiment 2 was conducted to verify that large VSA were not a by-product of children being unable to see each other. Thirteen participants carried out the same task faceto-face with their interlocutor. Comparisons to matched participants from experiment 1 showed no differences in VSA, indicating that the audio-only modality did not influence results. Possible reasons for larger VSA in the spontaneous speech of children and adolescents are discussed.},

The first project was designed to experimentally test several specific predictions derived from MACS, a simulation model of the Cohort Theory of word recognition. Using a priming paradigm, evidence was obtained for acoustic-phonetic activation in word recognition in three experiments. The second project describes the results of analyses of the structure and distribution of words in the lexicon using a large lexical database. Statistics about similarity spaces for high and low frequency words were applied to previously published data on the intelligibility of words presented in noise. Differences in identification were shown to be related to structural factors about the specific words and the distribution of similar words in their neighborhoods. Finally, the third project describes efforts at developing a new theory of word recognition known as Phonetic Refinement Theory. The theory is based on findings from human listeners and was designed to incorporate some of the detailed acoustic-phonetic and phonotactic knowledge that human listeners have about the internal structure of words and the organization of words in the lexicon, and how, they use this knowledge in word recognition. Taken together, the results of these projects demonstrate a number of new and important findings about the relation between speech perception and auditory word recognition, two areas of research that have traditionally been approached from quite different perspectives in the past.},

Participants were 90 thirty-month-olds exposed to Spanish and English. Using the Language Diary method to assess input and using multiple measures of children's bilingual skills, results replicated previous findings that the percent of input provided by native speakers is a positive quality indicator and found suggestive evidence that the number of speakers is also a positive quality indicator. There was little evidence that the frequency of language mixing is a negative indicator. These findings advance understanding of sources of variability in bilingual outcomes and have implications for programs to support bilingual development.},

They validate the framework and architecture by testing to see whether universals such as the prevalence of triangular vowel systems that show adequate dispersion in the F1-F2-F3 space can fall out of simulations of referential communication between social agents, without building principles such as dispersion directly into the model. In this paper, we examine the assumptions underlying the framework, beginning with the assumption that it is such substantive universals that are in need of explanation rather than the rich diversity of phonological systems observed across human cultures and the compositional (``prosodic'') structure that characterizes signed as well as spoken languages. Also, when emergence is construed at the time-scales of the biological evolution of the species and of the cultural evolution of distinct speech communities, it is the a liative or a{$\carriagereturn$}ective rather than the referential function that has the greater significance for our understanding of how phonological systems can emerge de novo in ontogeny.},

pronunciation variation. The focus was on the Dutch derivational suffix
-igheid (//), which occurs in two types of words. In the first type,
-igheid is analyzed as a single suffix. In the second type, there is a
morphological boundary between -ig and -heid. The main research
question was whether this difference is reflected in the duration of the
// cluster. Two hypotheses were distinguished: one based on prosodic
structure, which predicts that the cluster is shorter in the first type than in
the second type, and one based on the informativeness of the affix given
the morphological paradigm, which makes the opposite prediction. All
occurrences of -igheid in a corpus of read speech were acoustically
analyzed using Automatic Speech Recognition technology. The duration
of the // cluster was found to be shorter in words of the second type
than in words of the first type. This can be explained by the observation
that words of the second type have sparser morphological paradigms,
making the cluster less informative with respect to word identity.
Furthermore, this finding shows that morphological effects on fine
phonetic detail cannot always be explained by prosodic structure.},

  abstract = {In recent years, phonetic sciences has hosted several debates about the best way to statistically analyze data. The main discussion has been about moving away from analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to linear mixed effects models. Mixed models have the advantage both of allowing for including all data points produced by a participant (instead of computing means for each participant) and accounting for both by-participant and by-item variance. However, plotting of data has not always followed this trend. Often researchers plot participant means and standard error (as based on the number of participants), which, while potentially representative of the data used for an ANOVA, do not match the data used for a mixed effects model. The present paper discusses the shortcomings of traditional data visualization practices, solutions to these shortcomings that have been discussed in recent years, and the special challenges that come with trying to extend these solutions to phonetic data with crossed (withinparticipant and within-item) designs. For each of the problems discussed, we provide examples with simulated data to demonstrate how different plotting techniques can correctly, or incorrectly, represent the underlying structure of data. Ultimately we conclude that there is no single type of plot that can show everything one needs to know about this type of data, and we advocate for an approach that involves using different types of plots throughout data analysis, and making data publicly available.},

Here, we tested segmentation of bi-syllabic words in two languages (French; English) within the same infants in a single test session. In Experiment 1, monolingual 8-month-olds (French; English) segmented bi-syllabic words in their native language, but not in an unfamiliar and rhythmically different language. In Experiment 2, bilingual infants acquiring French and English demonstrated successful segmentation for French when it was tested first, but not for English and not for either language when tested second. There were no effects of language exposure on this pattern of findings. In Experiment 3, bilingual infants segmented the same English materials used in Experiment 2 when they were tested using the standard segmentation procedure, which provided more exposure to the test stimuli. These findings show that segmenting words in both their native languages in the dual-language task poses a distinct challenge for bilingual 8-month-olds acquiring French and English. Further research exploring early word segmentation will advance our understanding of bilingual acquisition and expand our fundamental knowledge of language and cognitive development.},

Infants showed greater recovery of interest to the contrasting vowel than to the habituation vowel, which demonstrates recognition of the habituationvowel category when it was produced by an infant. A second experiment showed that encoding the vowel category and detecting the novel vowel required additional processing when infant vowels were included in the habituation set. Despite these added cognitive demands, infants demonstrated the ability to track vowel categories in a multitalker array that included infant talkers. These findings raise the possibility that young infants can categorize their own vocalizations, which has important implications for early vocal learning.},

  abstract = {In bilingual language environments, infants and toddlers listen to two separate languages during the same key years that monolingual children listen to just one and bilinguals rarely learn each of their two languages at the same rate. Learning to understand language requires them to cope with challenges not found in monolingual input, notably the use of two languages within the same utterance (e.g., Do you like the perro? or \textquestiondown Te gusta el doggy?). For bilinguals of all ages, switching between two languages can reduce the efficiency in real-time language processing. But language switching is a dynamic phenomenon in bilingual environments, presenting the young learner with many junctures where comprehension can be derailed or even supported. In this study, we tested 20 Spanish\textendash English bilingual toddlers (18- to 30months) who varied substantially in language dominance. Toddlers' eye movements were monitored as they looked at familiar objects and listened to single-language and mixed-language sentences in both of their languages. We found asymmetrical switch costs when toddlers were tested in their dominant versus non-dominant language, and critically, they benefited from hearing nouns produced in their dominant language, independent of switching. While bilingualism does present unique challenges, our results suggest a united picture of early monolingual and bilingual learning. Just like monolinguals, experience shapes bilingual toddlers' word knowledge, and with more robust representations, toddlers are better able to recognize words in diverse sentences.},

We analyzed excerpts taken from daylong home audio recordings that were collected from nineteen 12- to 13-month-old American infants and their caregivers using the LENA system. Three 5-minute sections having high child vocalization rates were identified within each recording and coded by trained researchers. Infant and adult vocalizations were sequenced and defined as contingent if they occurred within 1 s, 2 s, or 5 s of each other. When using 1 s or 2 s definitions of temporal adjacency, infant vocalizations generally predicted subsequent infant-directed adult vocalizations. A reflexive vocalization (i.e. a cry or a laugh) was the strongest predictor. Likewise, within 1\textendash 2 s timeframes, infant-directed adult speech generally predicted infant vocalizations with reflexive vocalizations being particularly predictive. Infant vocalizations predicted fewer subsequent other-directed adult vocalizations and were less likely following other-directed adult vocalizations when considering up to 5 s lags. This suggests an understudied communicative role for infants of non-infant-directed adult speech. These results demonstrate the importance of timescale in studying infant-adult interactions, support the communicative significance of reflexive infant vocalizations and otherdirected adult speech in addition to more commonly studied vocalization types, and highlight the challenges of determining direction(s) of influence when using only two-event sequences.},

The range of variation in the consonants that children produce has significant implications for theories that predict children follow universal processes of consonant development as well as theories that predict individual children exhibit unique developments. The results show variation exists between children acquiring the same language as well as between children acquiring different languages. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the structure of the adult phonologies restricts the range of the children's variation within each language even though the children omit a variety of word-initial prefixes. The investigation of language acquisition in related languages reveals how children's attention to the adult language limits the operation of both universal and individual processes.},

A collaborative effort by researchers is required to identify the most efficient procedures for documenting children's language, and share them worldwide. This paper makes the case for documenting diversity and outlines steps needed to accomplish this goal.},

Individuals vary considerably in the degree to which they prefer irregular forms. This paper examines the degree to which individuals may converge on their regularization patterns and preferences. We report on a novel experimental methodology, using a cooperative game involving nonce verbs. Analysis of participants' post-game responses indicates that their behavior has shifted in response to an automated co-player's preferences, on two dimensions. First, players regularize more after playing with peers with high regularization rates, and less after playing with peers with low regularization rates. Second, players' overall pattern of regularization is also affected by the particular distribution of (ir)regular forms produced by the peer.},

In the present study we investigated the relationship between language input and language development, examining both the style of parental speech, comparing `parentese' speech to standard speech, and the social context in which speech is directed to children, comparing one-on-one (1:1) to group social interactions. Importantly, the language input variables were assessed at home using digital first-person perspective recordings of the infants' auditory environment as they went about their daily lives (N =26, 11- and 14-months-old). We measured language development using (a) concurrent speech utterances, and (b) word production at 24 months. Parentese speech in 1:1 contexts is positively correlated with both concurrent speech and later word production. Mediation analyses further show that the effect of parentese speech-1:1 on infants' later language is mediated by concurrent speech. Our results suggest that both the social context and the style of speech in language addressed to children are strongly linked to a child's future language development.},

Results showed that the amount of exposure to parentese speech-1:1 in infancy was related to productive vocabulary at 24 months. The general goal of the present study was to investigate changes in (1) the pattern of social interactions between caregivers and their children from infancy to childhood and (2) relationships among speech style, social context, and language learning across time. Our study sample consisted of 30 participants from the previously published infant studies, evaluated at 33 months of age. Social interactions were assessed at home using digital first-person perspective recordings of the auditory environment. We found that caregivers use less parentese speech-1:1, and more standard speech-1:1, as their children get older. Furthermore, we found that the effects of parentese speech-1:1 in infancy on later language development at 24 months persist at 33 months of age. Finally, we found that exposure to standard speech-1:1 in childhood was the only social interaction that related to concurrent word production/use. Mediation analyses showed that standard speech-1:1 in childhood fully mediated the effects of parentese speech1:1 in infancy on language development in childhood, controlling for SES. This study demonstrates that engaging in one-on-one interactions in infancy and later in life has important implications for language development.},

  abstract = {Formant frequency data for Catalan vowels reveal essentially the same degree of expansion for three dialect systems with seven vowels (Valencian, Eastern Catalan, Western Catalan). A slightly larger vowel space dispersion for a fourth system with those same vowels and stressed /c/ (Majorcan) is not clearly associated with a larger vowel system size but rather with a local effect of schwa in repelling neighbouring vowels or with specific requirements on the production of some peripheral vowels. Schwa appears to be targetless or specified for a widely defined mid central target. Intervocalic distances were found to vary according to dialect and to vowel pair, and to compensate with each other such that the maximal formant frequency range between point vowels is kept constant across dialects. These findings are partially in support of the Adaptive Dispersion Theory, i.e., they are in agreement with the claim that vowel system expansion should be proportional to vowel system size but not with the notion that adjacent vowels should be evenly spaced in identical vowel systems. Patterns of vowel variability differ depending on the contextual or non-contextual factors involved, i.e., F1 shows more contextual and token-to-token variation for open vs. close vowels, while F2 exhibits little contextual variation and much token-dependent variation for /i/ and the opposite trend for /u/ and /c/. These patterns are accounted for assuming that random variability for vowels is ruled by the precision involved in achieving a specific articulatory target, and that contextual variability is determined by the vowel articulatory requirements and by the relative compatibility between the articulatory gestures for adjacent vowels and consonants.},

Results indicate that most mid vowel pairs subjected to neutralization may be characterized as near-mergers. Merging appears to have proceeded through two stages: in the first place, one of the two mid vowel pairs undergoes neutralization yielding a relatively close mid vowel in the resulting six vowel system; then, the members of the second vowel pair approach each other until they cease to be contrastive, and the front and back mid vowels of the resulting five vowel system tend to occupy a fairly equidistant position with respect to the mid high and mid low cognates. Moreover, in six vowel systems wih a single mid vowel pair, the contrasting members of this pair approach each other if belonging to the back series but not if belonging to the front series. These findings are in support of two hypotheses: vowel systems tend to be symmetrical; reparation of six vowel systems is most prone to occur if the system is unoptimal. Predictions of the Adaptive Dispersion Theory were not supported by the data. Thus, smaller vowel systems turned out not to be less disperse than larger ones, and mid vowels were not clearly more variable in five or six vowel systems than in seven vowel systems. It appears that for these predictions to come into play, the systems being compared need to differ considerably in number of vowels.},

Method: Two groups of 12 children, 5 and 8 years old, and one group of 12 adults produced sentences with phrase-medial determiners. Preceding verbs were varied to create different metrical contexts for chunking the determiner with an adjacent content word. Following noun onsets were varied to assess the coherence of determiner-noun sequences. Determiner vowel duration, amplitude, and formant frequencies were measured.
Results: Children produced significantly longer and louder determiners than adults regardless of metrical context. The effect of noun onset on F1 was stronger in children's speech than in adult speech; the effect of noun onset on F2 was stronger in adults' speech than in children's. Effects of metrical context on anticipatory formant patterns were more evident in children's speech than in adults' speech.
Conclusion: The results suggest that both immature articulatory timing control and agerelated differences in how chunks are accessed or planned influence grammatical word production in school-aged children's speech. Future work will focus on the development of long-distance coarticulation to reveal the evolution of speech plan structure over time.},

Measures of absolute duration and variability in single vowel productions were extracted to evaluate the realization of contrasts (representation) and to index speech motor abilities (execution). Results were mostly consistent with a dissociation. Native English-speaking children produced the same language-specific temporal patterns as native English-speaking adults, but their productions were more variable than the adults'. In contrast, Korean-speaking adult learners of English typically produced different temporal patterns than native English-speaking adults, but their productions were as stable as the native speakers'.

Together these observations suggest an analogy with skilled behavior in the non-language domain. This analogy is used here to argue for a model of production that is grounded in the activity of speaking and structured during language acquisition. The focus is on the plan that controls the execution of fluent speech; specifically, on the units that are activated during the production of an intonational phrase. These units are schemas: temporally structured sequences of remembered actions and their sensory outcomes. Schemas are activated and inhibited via associated goals, which are linked to specific meanings. Schemas may fuse together over developmental time with repeated use to form larger units, thereby affecting the relative timing of sequential action in participating schemas. In this way, the hierarchical structure of the speech plan and ensuing rhythm patterns of speech are a product of development. Individual schemas may also become differentiated during development, but only if subsequences are associated with meaning. The necessary association of action and meaning gives rise to assumptions about the primacy of certain linguistic forms in the production process. Overall, schema representations connect usage-based theories of language to the action of speaking.},

The current study sought to further investigate these differences across groups in two ways. First, subphonemic acoustic properties were investigated in terms of dynamic acoustic features that indexed more than just the contrast between /s/ and /{$\Elzesh$}/. Second, we investigated whether such differences in subphonemic acoustic contrast between sibilant fricatives affected the intelligibility of sibilant-initial single word productions by children with CIs and their peers with NH. Design\textemdash In Experiment 1, productions of /s/ and /{$\Elzesh$}/ in word-initial prevocalic contexts were elicited from 22 children with bilateral CIs (aged 4 to 7 years) who had at least 2 years of CI experience and from 22 chronological age-matched peers with NH. Acoustic features were measured from 17 points across the fricatives: peak frequency was measured to index the place of articulation contrast; spectral variance and amplitude drop were measured to index the degree of sibilance. These acoustic trajectories were fitted with growth-curve models to analyze timevarying spectral change. In Experiment 2, phonemically accurate word productions that were elicited in Experiment 1 were embedded within four-talker babble and played to 80 adult listeners with NH. Listeners were asked to repeat the words, and their accuracy rate was used as a measure of the intelligibility of the word productions. Regression analyses were run to test which acoustic properties measured in Experiment 1 predicted the intelligibility scores from Experiment 2.},

Vocalization patterns, phonetic inventories, and syllable formation patterns were compared. Toddlers with SLI-E vocalized significantly less often than their typically developing peers, had proportionately smaller consonantal and vowel inventories, and used a more restricted and less mature array of syllable shapes. Although the mean incidence of phoneme usage varied significantly inall comparisons, profiles of consonant usage were similar between the two groups for initial phoneme usage, but considerably different for final consonant closure. Such patterns of vocal and phonetic behavior confirm earlier reports of phonetic delay in SLI-E, and suggest that nongrammatical factors contribute to the development of expressive language deficits in toddlers. We further propose a bidirectional model for the expressive deficits in SLI-E, in which the child's limited phonetic capacity interacts with propensities in caretaker interaction to further reduce opportunities for expressive language learning and practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study explored the effect of frequency (number of presentations), and spacing (period between presentations) on verb learning in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Children learn words more efficiently when presentations are frequent and appropriately spaced, and this study investigated whether children with SLI likewise benefit. Given that these children demonstrate greater frequency dependence and rapid forgetting of recently acquired words, an investigation of frequency and spacing in this population is especially warranted.
Method: Twenty-four children with SLI (mean age 5;6 [years;months]) and 24 language-matched control children (mean age 3;4) were taught novel verbs during play sessions. In a repeated measures design, 4 experimental conditions combined frequency (12 or 18 presentations) and spacing (all presentations in 1 session, or spread over 4 days). Comprehension and production probes were administered after the final session and 1 week later.
Results: Although the children with SLI benefited significantly from frequent and widely spaced presentations, there were no significant effect in the control group. The language-impaired children showed rapid forgetting.
Conclusions: The frequency and spacing of presentations crucially affect the verb learning of children with SLI. A training regimen characterized by appropriately spaced intervals and moderate repetition will optimally benefit lexical learning.},

These so-called ``researcher degrees of freedom'' (Simmons, Nelson, \& Simonsohn, 2011) can affect the results and the conclusions researcher draw from it. It is argued that phonetic research faces a large number of researcher degrees of freedom due to its scientific object \textendash{} speech \textendash{} being inherently multidimensional and exhibiting complex interactions between multiple covariates. A Type-I error simulation is presented that demonstrates the severe inflation of false positives when exploring researcher degrees of freedom. It is argued that combined with common cognitive fallacies, exploitation of researcher degrees of freedom introduces strong bias and poses a serious challenge to quantitative phonetics as an empirical science. This paper discusses potential remedies for this problem including adjusting the threshold for significance; drawing a clear line between confirmatory and exploratory analyses via preregistration; open, honest and transparent practices in communicating data analytical decisions; and direct replications.},

  abstract = {In the first years of life, children differ greatly from adults in the temporal organization of their speech gestures in fluent language production. However, dissent remains as to the maturational direction of such organization. The present study sheds new light on this process by tracking the development of anticipatory vowel-to-vowel coarticulation in a cross-sectional investigation of 62 German children (from 3.5 to 7 years of age) and 13 adults. It focuses on gestures of the tongue, a complex organ whose spatiotemporal control is indispensable for speech production. The goal of the study was threefold: 1) investigate whether children as well as adults initiate the articulation for a target vowel in advance of its acoustic onset, 2) test if the identity of the intervocalic consonant matters and finally, 3) describe age-related developments of these lingual coarticulatory patterns. To achieve this goal, ultrasound tongue imaging was used to record lingual movements and quantify changes in coarticulation degree as a function of consonantal context and age. Results from linear mixed effects models indicate that like adults, children initiate vowels' lingual gestures well ahead of their acoustic onset. Second, while the identity of the intervocalic consonant affects the degree of vocalic anticipation in adults, it does not in children at any age. Finally, the degree of vowelto-vowel coarticulation is significantly higher in all cohorts of children than in adults. However, among children, a developmental decrease of vocalic coarticulation is only found for sequences including the alveolar stop /d/ which requires finer spatiotemporal coordination of the tongue's subparts compared to labial and velar stops. Altogether, results suggest greater gestural overlap in child than in adult speech and support the view of a non-uniform and protracted maturation of lingual coarticulation calling for thorough considerations of the articulatory intricacies from which subtle developmental differences may originate.},

For example, when contrasting patients to controls, variables such as intelligence or socioeconomic status are often correlated with patient status. Similarly, when presenting word stimuli, variables such as word frequency are often correlated with primary variables of interest. One procedure very commonly employed to control for such nuisance effects is conducting inferential tests on confounding stimulus or subject characteristics. For example, if word length is not significantly different for two stimulus sets, they are considered as matched for word length. Such a test has high error rates and is conceptually misguided. It reflects a common misunderstanding of statistical tests: interpreting significance not to refer to inference about a particular population parameter, but about 1. the sample in question, 2. the practical relevance of a sample difference (so that a nonsignificant test is taken to indicate evidence for the absence of relevant differences). We show inferential testing for assessing nuisance effects to be inappropriate both pragmatically and philosophically, present a survey showing its high prevalence, and briefly discuss an alternative in the form of regression including nuisance variables.},

            Four- and five-year-old children took part in an elicited familiar and novel Lithuanian noun production task to test predictions of input-based accounts of the acquisition of inflectional morphology.

Second, the error patterns were not compatible with the systematic substitution of target forms by either (a) the most frequent form of that noun or (b) a single morphosyntactic default form, as might be predicted by naive versions of a constructivist and generativist account, respectively. Rather, most errors reflected near-miss substitutions of singular for plural, masculine for feminine, or nominative/accusative for a less frequent case.

Ten postlingually deafened subjects (5 male/5 female) were recorded reading a German text before and 3 and 12 months after implantation, respectively. Selected vowels were analysed regarding the fundamental frequency (F0), the formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3) and the vowel space (difference between F1 and F2 in hertz). The F0 decreased only descriptively after 3 and 12 months, respectively. F1 of the vowel /e/ was significantly lower after 12 months (411 B 20 compared to 349 B 25 Hz, p \^ 0.05) and for /o/ after 3 months (446 B 29 compared to 408 B 31 Hz, p \^ 0.05) for the male patients: their vowel space also expanded significantly for the vowel /o/ (372 B 37 compared to 467 B 32 Hz, p \^ 0.05) after 12 months. Regained auditory feedback after cochlear implantation had an effect on the improvement of the production of vowels.},

For each child, eight words involved phonological characteristics which had been evidenced in production (IN) and eight had characteristics which had not been evidenced in production or selection (OUT), IN words were produced imitatively and non-imitatively in greater numbers and in earlier sessions than OUT words, providing evidence for the influence of selection and avoidance. The degree of phonetic accuracy of these two types of productions did not differ. These findings are discussed in terms of a proposal concerning early phonological representation and acquisition.},

  abstract = {There is a substantial literature describing how infants become more sensitive to differences between native phonemes (sounds that are both present and meaningful in the input) and less sensitive to differences between non-native phonemes (sounds that are neither present nor meaningful in the input) over the course of development. Here, we review an emergent strand of literature that gives a more nuanced notion of the problem of sound category learning. This research documents infants' discovery of phonological status, signaled by a decrease in sensitivity to sounds that map onto the same phonemic category vs. different phonemic categories. The former phones are present in the input, but their difference does not cue meaning distinctions because they are tied to one and the same phoneme. For example, the diphthong I in I'm should map to the same underlying category as the diphthong in I'd, despite the fact that the first vowel is nasal and the second oral. Because such pairs of sounds are processed differently than those than map onto different phonemes by adult speakers, the learner has to come to treat them differently as well. Interestingly, there is some evidence that infants' sensitivity to dimensions that are allophonic in the ambient language declines as early as 11 months. We lay out behavioral research, corpora analyses, and computational work which sheds light on how infants achieve this feat at such a young age. Collectively, this work suggests that the computation of complementary distribution and the calculation of phonetic similarity operate in concert to guide infants toward a functional interpretation of sounds that are present in the input, yet not lexically contrastive. In addition to reviewing this literature, we discuss broader implications for other fundamental theoretical and empirical questions.},

This presents a puzzle: How have infants been able to pull out these words from the continuous stream of speech at such a young age? We hypothesize that caregivers' interactions directed at and on the infant's body may be at the root of their early acquisition of body part words. An artificial language segmentation study shows that experimenter-provided synchronous tactile cues help 4-month-olds to find words in continuous speech. A follow-up study suggests that this facilitation cannot be reduced to the highly social situation in which the directed interaction occurs. Taken together, these studies suggest that direct caregiver\textendash infant interaction, exemplified in this study by touch cues, may play a key role in infants' ability to find word boundaries, and suggests that early vocabulary items may consist of words often linked with caregiver touches.},

One possible source for these effects is phonetic paradigm uniformity, in which an intended word's phonetic realisation is influenced by its morphological relatives. For example, the realisation of the inflected word frees should be influenced by the phonological plan for free, and thus be non-homophonous with the morphologically-simple word freeze. We test this prediction by analysing productions of forty such inflected/simple word pairs, embedded in pseudo-conversational speech structured to avoid metalinguistic task effects, and balanced for frequency, orthography, as well as segmental and prosodic context. We find that stem and suffix durations are significantly longer by about 4\textendash 7\% in fricative-final inflected words (frees, laps) compared to their simple counterparts (freeze, lapse), while we find a null effect for stop-final words. The result suggests that wordforms influence production of their relatives.},

  abstract = {Research on English and other languages has shown that syllables and words that contain more information tend to be produced with longer duration. This research is evolving into a general thesis that speakers articulate linguistic units with more information more robustly. While this hypothesis seems plausible from the perspective of communicative efficiency, previous support for it has come mainly from English and some other Indo-European languages. Moreover, most previous studies focus on global effects, such as the interaction of word duration and sentential/ semantic predictability. The current study is focused at the level of phonotactics, exploring the effects of local predictability on vowel duration in Japanese, using the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese. To examine gradient consonant-vowel phonotactics within a consonant\textendash vowel-mora, consonant-conditioned Surprisal and Shannon Entropy were calculated, and their effects on vowel duration were examined, together with other linguistic factors that are known from previous research to affect vowel duration. Results show significant effects of both Surprisal and Entropy, as well as notable interactions with vowel length and vowel quality. The effect of Entropy is stronger on peripheral vowels than on central vowels. Surprisal has a stronger positive effect on short vowels than on long vowels. We interpret the main patterns and the interactions by conceptualizing Surprisal as an index of motor fluency and Entropy as an index of competition in vowel selection.},

A substantial portion of new words enter Chinese via this process, and all combinations of four underlying syllables are attested in disyllabic neologisms. Variation in which syllable of the base escapes truncation has been described as arbitrary, but our analysis uncovers a clear pattern. Informative syllables survive. We fit a logistic regression model to Chinese truncation patterns using two indices of informativity, constituent family size and frequency ratio. Both of these factors were significant predictors. To further explore the nature of informativity-based constraints on surface forms, we analysed the truncation probabilities predicted by the model for each base in the neologism corpus. As truncation probabilities increased so too did model accuracy. We interpret this result as evidence for a constraint regulating the degree of uncertainty in base-truncation mappings.},

However, in many communities children are reported to be directly engaged by their caregivers only rarely (). This observation raises the possibility that these children learn language from observing, rather than participating in, communicative exchanges. In this paper, we quantify naturally occurring language input in one community where directed interaction with children has been reported to be rare (Yucatec Mayan). We compare this input to the input heard by children growing up in large families in the United States, and we consider how directed and overheard input relate to Mayan children's later vocabulary. In Study 1, we demonstrate that 1-year-old Mayan children do indeed hear a smaller proportion of total input in directed speech than children from the US. In Study 2, we show that for Mayan (but not US) children, there are great increases in the proportion of directed input that children receive between 13 and 35 months. In Study 3, we explore the validity of using videotaped data in a Mayan village. In Study 4, we demonstrate that word types directed to Mayan children from adults at 24 months (but not word types overheard by children or word types directed from other children) predict later vocabulary. These findings suggest that adult talk directed to children is important for early word learning, even in communities where much of children's early language input comes from overheard speech.},

  abstract = {Adults produce rapid, interleaved sequences of speech sounds by controlling the relative motions in time and space of the oral articulators. The control and coordination of these effectors appear to be automatic, effortless, and usually error free. If speech production is viewed within the framework of classical motor control theories, we can infer that adults have organized functional synergies (consistent patterns of activation of muscle collectives) that act as stable subunits. In this study, the development of these stable functional synergies is examined. Motion of the upper lip, lower lip, and jaw was recorded during sentence production in 180 children and adults (aged 4\textendash 22 years). Two indices of oral motor coordination were computed, which reflect the degree of trial-to-trial consistency in intereffector relationships and thus the stability of the underlying functional synergies. Major findings are: (a) The time course of development for speech motor coordination is protracted, (b) speech motor control processes are not adultlike until after age 14 years for both females and males, (c) boys (until age 5 years) show a slower maturational course of speech motor development, and (d) late childhood (the 7- to 12-year period) is characterized by a plateau in the development of these coordinative synergies for speech production. We posit that multiple factors are likely to contribute to the protracted development of oral motor coordination for speech, including maturation of components of the motor system itself and maturation of the brain subsystems for language processing.},

  abstract = {Most English prefixes are syllables that can also begin words in which they do not function as a productive prefix. The literature notes a pronunciation difference such that true-prefixes, e.g. /dis/ in discolour, have a heavier rhythmic beat than pseudo-prefixes, e.g. /dis/ in discover. When the syllable following dis- or mis- begins with a voiceless stop, there is a clear difference in its VOT, but differences in dis/mis itself are more subtle and have not been systematically measured. Five speakers of Southern British English engaged in 40 scripted dialogues which contained such words in controlled phonetic contexts. Prefixed words were longer up to voicing onset in syllable 2 and had longer and more peripheral [i], longer VOT, and shorter [s] than pseudo-prefixed words. These differences produced distinctive acoustic patterns consistent with the difference in perceived beat. Effects due to nuclear/ postnuclear accent and word frequency were observed, but appear to be secondary to effects of morphological status. We conclude that the morphological status of these syllables is the primary cause of their characteristic acoustic patterns, and that their segmental composition dictates further reduction processes they may undergo due to weaker prosodic contexts, higher word frequency, casual register, and other influences.},

  abstract = {Children (aged 4 and 7 years) and young adults produced a six-syllable utterance 15 times. The displacement of the lower lip was recorded with an Optotrak system and analyzed in a number of ways. First, using a procedure recently developed in our laboratory, displacement records from the 15 repetitions were amplitude- and time-normalized, and the spatiotemporal index (the STI) was computed. The STI reflects the degree to which repeated performance of a task produces movement trajectories that converge on a single pattern. Children produced less stable movement trajectories, as reflected in higher values on the STI. In a second analysis, standard measurements of amplitude and peak velocity were made for two opening and two closing lip movements. These measures suggested that, relative to the size of their oral structures, children have large movement ranges in speech. Also, children tend to move with a lower peak velocity. This large-amplitude, low-velocity movement style may reflect different underlying control processes. Finally, another analysis focused on open-dose movement sequences associated with two words of the utterance. A pattern-recognition algorithm applied to the normalized waveforms from the open--close sequences revealed that children and adults produced equally distinctive movement trajectories for the two syllables. Taken together, these preliminary results suggest that nonlinear and nonuniform changes occur in components of the speech motor system during development.},

The resulting data were not influenced by the demographic variables of population density (rural/urban), SES (based on parental education), or state of residence (Iowa/Nebraska); however, sex of the child exerted a significant influence in some of the preschool age groups. The criteria used to determine acceptability of a production appeared to influence outcomes for some speech sounds. Acquisition curves were plotted for individual phoneme targets or groups of targets. These curves were used to develop recommended ages of acquisition for the tested speech sounds, with recommendations based generally on a 90\% level of acquisition.

We explored how acquisition proceeds in the absence of possible cognitive or maturational roadblocks, by examining the acquisition of English in internationally adopted preschoolers. Like infants, and unlike other second-language learners, these children acquire language from child-directed speech, without access to bilingual informants. Parental reports and speech samples were collected from 27 preschoolers, 3 to 18 months after they were adopted from China. These children showed the same developmental patterns in language production as monolingual infants (matched for vocabulary size). Early on, their vocabularies were dominated by nouns, their utterances were short, and grammatical morphemes were generally omitted. Children at later stages had more diverse vocabularies and produced longer utterances with more grammatical morphemes.},

Our specific question was: Does the child start by producing a ``canonical'' form of a phoneme (e.g., /t/ with a clear closure and a release burst), only later learning to produce its other phonetic variants (e.g., unreleased stop, flap, and glottal stop)? Or, does the child start by producing the appropriate phonetic variants in the appropriate contexts and only later learn that they are phonetic variants of the same phoneme? In order to address this question, we investigated the production of three phonetic variants (unreleased stop, flap, and glottal stop) of the alveolar stop codas /t, d/ in the spontaneous speech of 6 AmericanEnglish-speaking mother\textendash child dyads, using both acoustic and perceptual coding. The results showed that 2year-old children produced all three variants significantly less often than their mothers, and produced acoustic cues to canonical /t, d/ more often. This supports the view that young children start out by producing a fully articulated canonical variant of a phoneme in contexts where an adult would produce non-canonical forms. The implications of these findings for early phonological representations are discussed.},

However, most of the observational work on which this claim is based has concerned itself with word-initial onset consonants; little is known about how and when fricatives are mastered in word-final coda position (e.g., nose). This is all the more critical in a language like English, where word-final fricatives often carry important morphological information (e.g., toes, goes). This study examines the development of duration cues to the voicing feature contrast in coda fricatives, using longitudinal spontaneous speech data from CVC words (e.g., noise vs face) produced by three children (1;6\textendash 2;6 years) and six mothers. Results show that the children were remarkably adult-like in the use of duration cues to voicing contrasts in fricatives even in this early age range. Furthermore the children, like the mothers, had longer frication noise durations for morphemic compared to non-morphemic fricatives (e.g., toes vs nose) when these segments occurred in utterance-final position. These results suggest that although children's fricatives tend to be overall longer and more voiced compared to those of adults, the voicing and morphological contrasts for fricative codas are acquired early in production.},

Less is known about the articulatory aspects of early speech, or the development of articulatory-acoustic mapping. Recent research on adult speech finds that coarticulation effects are evidenced in both the acoustics and the articulatory gestures, and suggests tighter coarticulation and less variability for monomorphemic compared to polymorphemic segment sequences. The present study explored phonological context and morphological effects in the speech of five adults and five 2-year-olds, combining acoustic and articulatory analysis from ultrasound recordings. The results show that coarticulation effects are found in the word-final consonant cluster (box) for both adults and children. For children, these were evidenced only in the articulatory data. In addition, both age groups showed differences in tongue height between the monomorphemic (box) and bimorphemic (rocks) clusters, suggesting a possible morphological effect. These findings confirm that ultrasound methods can be successfully employed to explore aspects of early gestural development in children as young as 2, and raise many questions regarding the nature of speech planning processes as a function of lexical versus morphological form.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Controlled experiment in a natural environment of parent-infant communication during play with 3 different toy sets. Participant recruitment and data collection were conducted between February 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014. The volunteer sample included 26 parent-infant (aged 10-16 months) dyads. Editorial page 112 Related article page 184 EXPOSURES Fifteen-minute in-home parent-infant play sessions with electronic toys, traditional toys, and books. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Numbers of adult words, child vocalizations, conversational turns, parent verbal responses to child utterances, and words produced by parents in 3 different semantic categories (content-specific words) per minute during play sessions.
RESULTS Among the 26 parent-infant dyads, toy type was associated with all outcome measures. During play with electronic toys, there were fewer adult words (mean, 39.62; 95\% CI, 33.36-45.65), fewer conversational turns (mean, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.19), fewer parental responses (mean, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.77), and fewer productions of content-specific words (mean, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.35) than during play with traditional toys or books. Children vocalized less during play with electronic toys (mean per minute, 2.9; 95\% CI, 2.16-3.69) than during play with books (mean per minute, 3.91; 95\% CI, 3.09-4.68). Parents produced fewer words during play with traditional toys (mean per minute, 55.56; 95\% CI, 46.49-64.17) than during play with books (mean per minute, 66.89; 95\% CI, 59.93-74.19) and use of content-specific words was lower during play with traditional toys (mean per minute, 4.09; 95\% CI, 3.26-4.99) than during play with books (mean per minute, 6.96; 95\% CI, 6.07-7.97).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Play with electronic toys is associated with decreased quantity and quality of language input compared with play with books or traditional toys. To promote early language development, play with electronic toys should be discouraged. Traditional toys may be a valuable alternative for parent-infant play time if book reading is not a preferred activity.},

Method\textemdash Fifteen toddlers between 2;0 and 2;5 produced monosyllabic target words varying in word frequency, PND, AoA, and phonotactic probability. Phonetic transcription was used to determine (1) whole-word variability and (2) proportion of whole-word proximity (PWP) (Ingram, 2002) of each target word produced.
Results\textemdash Results showed a significant effect of PND on both proximity and variability (words from dense neighborhoods were closer to the adult targets and less variable than those from sparse neighborhoods), a significant effect of word frequency on variability (high frequency words were less variable) but not proximity, and a significant effect of AoA on proximity (earlier acquired words were farther from the adult target than later acquired words) but not variability.
Conclusions\textemdash Results provide new information regarding the role lexical and phonological factors play in the speech of young children; specifically, several factors are identified that influence variability of production. Additionally, by examining lexical and phonological factors simultaneously, the current study is able to isolate differential effects of individual factors that have often been conflated in previous work. Implications for our understanding of emerging phonological representations are discussed.},

Three languages are investigated: Cantonese, American English, and Dutch. Regression analyses revealed that functional load accounted for 55\% of the variance in age of emergence of consonants in 7 English-speaking children (8\textendash 25 months), while frequency of consonants in the ambient language accounted for 63\% of the variance in age of emergence of consonants in 51 Cantonesespeaking children (15\textendash 30 months). Articulatory complexity accounted for 40\% of the accuracy of production of consonants in 40 English-speaking children (25 months), and frequency accounted for 43\% of the variance in accuracy of production of consonants in 5 Dutch-speaking children (24 months).

Method: Parents of 222 British-English\textendash speaking children aged 27({$\pm$}3) months completed a British adaptation of the MacArthur\textendash Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (MCDI; Klee \& Harrison, 2001). Child words were coded for ND and WF, and the relationships among vocabulary, ND, and WF were examined. A cut-point of \textendash 1 SD below the mean on the MCDI classified children into one of two groups: low or high vocabulary size. Group differences on ND and WF were examined using nonparametric statistics.
Results: In a hierarchical regression, ND and WF accounted for 47\% and 14\% of unique variance in MCDI scores, respectively. Low-vocabulary children scored significantly higher on ND and significantly lower on WF than did high-vocabulary children, but there was more variability in ND and WF for children at the lowest points of the vocabulary continuum.
Conclusion: Children at the lowest points of a continuum of vocabulary size may be extracting statistical properties of the input language in a manner quite different from their more able age peers.},

            Analyzing the development of the noun-to-verb ratio in a longitudinal corpus of four Chintang (Sino-Tibetan) children, we find that up to about age four, children have a significantly higher ratio than adults. Previous cross-linguistic research rules out an explanation of this in terms of a universal noun bias; instead, a likely cause is that Chintang verb morphology is polysynthetic and difficult to learn. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the development of Chintang children's noun-to-verb ratio correlates significantly with the extent to which they show a similar flexibility with verbal morphology to that of the surrounding adults, as measured by morphological paradigm entropy. While this development levels off around age three, children continue to have a higher overall noun-to-verb ratio than adults. A likely explanation lies in the kinds of activities that children are engaged in and that are almost completely separate from adults' activities in this culture.},

Thirty-two children were exposed to homonyms and novel words in a story with visual support and learning was measured in two tasks: referent identification; picture naming. Results showed that responses to homonyms were as accurate as responses to novel words in the referent identification task. In contrast, responses to homonyms were more accurate than responses to novel words in the picture-naming task. Furthermore, homonyms composed of common sound sequences were named more accurately than those composed of rare sound sequences. The influence of word frequency was less straightforward.

Children classified the similarity of test words relative to a standard word to determine neighbourhood membership. The similarity relationship between the test and standard words varied orthogonally in terms of type of similarity and position of overlap. Standard words were drawn from neighbourhoods differing in density. Results showed that dense neighbourhoods were organized by phoneme similarity in the onset+nucleus or rhyme positions of overlap. In contrast, sparse neighbourhoods appeared to be organized by phoneme similarity in the onset+nucleus, but manner similarity in the rhyme.

In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to another? We focus on goose-fronting and /l/-darkening in Southern British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark realisations of the /l/ appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g. hula), there is more /u:/-fronting, and the /l/ is relatively lighter. We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fool-ing in 20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences, whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula{$\sim$}fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a small number of either /u:/ or /l/ allophonic categories. Instead, we interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation.},

However, some empirical evidence also suggests that morphological processes may trigger phonetically gradient processes, that is, processes that involve fine phonetic differences, but involve no change in phonological categories. Such findings challenge modular or discrete feedforward theories of grammatical architecture, which counterpredict direct interactions between morphology and phonetics. This article reviews some of the findings in this area, pointing to two types of difficulty in interpreting evidence of morphologically-conditioned phonetic gradience. The first one involves significance and replicability in experimental sciences, which become especially problematic when fine phonetic detail is examined and the magnitude of differences involved is very small. The second one concerns identifying what is causing the phonetic effects among a wealth of possibilities, including paradigmatic relationships, morphological structure, prosody, and informativity.},

  abstract = {Consonant-vowel productions at two distinct stages of language development were studied in a single female child. At 12 months canonical babbling syllables (N= 144) identified by a panel of listeners as comprising [bV], [dV], and [gv] tokens were acoustically analyzed by measuring F2 transition onset and F2 midvowel frequencies and plotting their relationship as locus equations for each stop category. Aregression analysis performed on these scatterplots revealed differential slopes and y-intercepts as afunction of stop place. The same analysis was performed 9 months later on CV utterances (N= 243) produced as syllable-initial segments of real words by the same child. Whereas labial and velar locus equation parameters moved toward more adult-like values, alveolar slope and y-intercept moved away from adult values and more inthe direction of decreased coarticulation between vowel and consonant. There was greater scatter of data points around the regression line for production of words compared to babbling. These results are compared to locus equations obtained from 3-5-year-olds and adults. Locus equations appear to be useful as an empirical developmental probe to document how CV productions gradually approach adult categorical standards.},

This study introduces a new method to assess the effect of age at implantation on cochlear implant outcomes: developmental trajectory analysis (DTA). DTA compares curves representing change in an outcome measure over time (i.e. developmental trajectories) for two groups of children that differ along a potentially important independent variable (e.g. age at intervention). This method was used to compare language development and speech perception outcomes in children who received cochlear implants in the second, third or fourth year of life. Within this range of age at implantation, it was found that implantation before the age of 2 resulted in speech perception and language advantages that were significant both from a statistical and a practical point of view. Additionally, the present results are consistent with the existence of a `sensitive period' for language development, a gradual decline in language acquisition skills as a function of age.},

We present the first evidence indicating that, in fact, the lexical representations of 14- and 15-month-olds are encoded in fine detail, even when this detail is not functionally necessary for distinguishing similar words in the infant's vocabulary. Exposure to words is sufficient for well-specified lexical representations, even well before the vocabulary spurt. These results suggest developmental continuity in infants' representations of speech: As infants begin to build a vocabulary and learn word meanings, they use the perceptual abilities previously demonstrated in tasks testing the discrimination and categorization of meaningless syllables.},

Under these conditions children almost always chose the familiar object, though examination of eye movements showed that children did detect the tested phonological distinctions. Thus, children discounted perceptible phonological variations when doing so permitted a resolution of the speaker's meaning without postulating a new word. Children with larger vocabularies made novel-word interpretations more often than children with smaller vocabularies did.

Method: Participants were 25 children with cochlear implants and their parents. Age at implantation ranged from 6 months to 42 months (Mage = 20.4 months, SD = 22.0 months). Linguistic progress was assessed at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after implantation. At each data point, language measures were based on parental questionnaire and 45-min spontaneous speech samples. Children's language and parents' child-directed language were analyzed. Results: On all language measures, children displayed considerable vocabulary and grammatical growth over time. Although there was no overall effect of age at implantation, younger and older children had different growth patterns. Children implanted by age 24 months made the most marked progress earlier on, whereas children implanted thereafter did so later on. Higher levels of maternal education were associated with faster linguistic progress; age at implantation was not. Properties of maternal language input, mean length of utterance, and expansions were associated with children's linguistic progress independently of age at implantation. Conclusions: In children implanted within the sensitive period for language learning, children's home language environment contributes more crucially to their linguistic progress than does age at implantation.},

A unique feature of the study is that all factors are considered simultaneously. Fifty-seven typically developing children were tested with a NWR task containing 150 nonwords differing in length, phonotactic probability, lexical neighbourhood and phonological complexity. The results indicate that phonological processing of novel words draws on sublexical representations at all grain sizes and that these representations are phonological, unstructured and insensitive to morphemehood. We propose a novel index \textendash{} mean ngram frequency of all phonemes \textendash{} that best captures the extent to which a nonword draws on sublexical representations. The study demonstrates the primacy of sublexical representations in NWR performance with implications for the nature of the deficit in SLI.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              Children with cochlear implants (CIs) face challenges in acquiring tonal languages, as CIs do not efficiently code pitch information. Mandarin is a tonal language with lexical tones and tonal processes such as neutral tone and tone sandhi, exhibiting contextually conditioned tonal realizations. Previous studies suggest that early implantation and long CI experience facilitate the acquisition of lexical tones by children with CIs. However, there is lack of acoustic evidence on children's tonal productions demonstrating that this is the case, and it is unclear whether and how children with CIs are able to acquire contextual tones. This study therefore examined the acoustic realization of both lexical tones and contextual tones as produced by children fitted with CIs, exploring the potential effects of age at implantation and length of CI experience on their acquisition of the Mandarin tonal system.
            
            
              Method
              Seventy-two Mandarin-learning preschoolers with CIs, varying in age at implantation (13\textendash 42 months) and length of CI experience (2\textendash 49 months), and 44 normal hearing 3-year-old controls were recruited. Tonal productions were elicited from both groups using picture-naming tasks and acoustically compared.
            
            
              Results
              Only the early implanted group (i.e., implanted before the age of 2 years) produced normal-like lexical tones and generally had contextual tones approximating those of the normal-hearing children. The other children, including those with longer CI experience, did not have typical tonal productions; their pitch patterns for lexical tones tended to be flatter, and contextual tone productions were unchanged across tonal contexts.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Children with CIs face challenges in acquiring Mandarin tones, but early implantation may help them to develop normal-like lexical tone categories, which further facilitates their implementation of contextual tones.

In the current research, we studied the end-state comfort effect, the tendency to ensure a comfortable position at the end rather than at the beginning of simple object manipulation tasks.

In Experiment 1, only 10-year-olds reached the same level of sensitivity to end-state comfort as adults, and 8-year-olds were less efficient than 6year-olds. In each age group, children's sensitivity did not increase during a session: i.e., either clearly showed the sensitivity or showed no sensitivity at all. Experiment 2 replicated these results when the bar was replaced by a pencil and when the task did not require much precision. However, when the task required more precision, 8-year-olds increased their level of sensitivity to the end-state comfort effect, whereas this was not the case for younger children. These results describe the development of advanced planning processes from 4 to 10 years of age as well as the positive effect of task constraints on the end-state comfort effect for 8year-olds.},

A strong relationship was found between amount of exposure to a language and performance in that language. This relationship was different for receptive and expressive vocabulary. Children having been exposed to both languages equally scored comparably to monolingual children in receptive vocabulary, but greater exposure was required to match monolingual standards in expressive vocabulary. Contrary to many previous studies, the bilingual children were not found to exhibit a significant gap relative to monolingual children in receptive vocabulary. This was attributed to the favorable languagelearning environment for French and English in Montreal and might also be related to the fact the two languages are fairly closely related. Children with early and late onset (before 6 months and after 20 months) of bilingual exposure who were equated on overall amount of exposure to each language did not differ significantly on any vocabulary measure.},

Moreover, current phonological theories and speech production models fail to explain cross-linguistic and developmental variation in the organization of units. This paper presents the selectioncoordination theory of speech production, which attempts to unify our understanding of developmental and crosslinguistic variation in phonological structure. The theory holds that hierarchical organization emerges from a recurring trend in speech development whereby children acquire coordinative regimes of control over articulatory gestures that were previously competitively selected. In this framework, segments, moras, and syllables are understood as differently-sized instantiations of the same type of motor planning unit, and cross-linguistic and developmental phonological patterns are derived from distinguishing competitive and coordinative regimes of articulatory control. Evidence for the theory is drawn from research in motor control, speech development, and phonological and phonetic patterns in speech.},

In the present study, we investigated to what extent these differences arise due to anticipatory coarticulation of inflectional exponents and the amount of long-term practice with individual verbs such as American English ''clean'', ''cleaned'', ''cleans'', ''cleaning''. Kinematic studies of hand movements show that with greater practice, i.e. regular repetition of a sequence of gestures, upcoming gestures are stronger and smoother anticipated. Consequently, we hypothesized to find stronger anticipatory coarticulation of inflectional exponents during the articulation of the stem vowel in verbs for which speakers acquired a greater lexical proficiency, as their articulatory gestures were better practiced. We observed both, stronger anticipatory coarticulation towards the offset of the gesture and less coarticulation concomittant with more hyperarticulation towards the onset of the gesture. We link these results to findings that morphological function is reflected in fine phonetic detail, challenging traditional models of speech production, which assume a separation of lexical information and the phonetic detail.},

From a crosslinguistic perspective, the phonological process patterns exhibited coincide broadly with universal tendencies, although some language specific patterns were also evident. In contrast, a case study of a phonologically disordered child indicated that her system was characterised by the use of idiosyncratic phonological rules as well as delayed acquisition of some aspects of the system. This atypical pattern reflects reports of phonologically disordered children learning other languages. Thefindings indicate that the deficit underlying this type of phonological disorder leads to similar phonological behaviour irrespective of the language being acquired.},

Infants discriminated both native contrasts similarly well, but did not discriminate the non-native contrast. We sought further evidence for subtle differences in the processing of the two native contrasts using near-infrared spectroscopy and a within-participant design (Experiment 2). The neuroimaging data did not provide additional evidence that responses to native contrasts are modulated by frequency of exposure. These results suggest that even large differences in exposure to a native contrast may not directly translate to behavioral and neural indicators of perceptual attunement, raising the possibility that frequency of exposure does not influence improvements in discriminating native contrasts.},

  abstract = {Language dominance is a multidimensional construct comprising several distinct yet interrelated components, including language proficiency, exposure and use. The exact relation between these components remains unclear. Several studies have observed a (non-linear) relationship between bilingual children's amount of exposure and absolute proficiency in each language, but our understanding of the relationship between language exposure and use and relative proficiency is limited. To address this question, we examined whether experiential-based measures of language dominance, operationalised here in the narrow sense of relative language proficiency, can provide an efficient alternative to the more labor-intensive performance-based measures often used in the literature. In earlier work, Unsworth (2016a) examined the relationship between relative proficiency and language exposure and use in a group of English\textendash Dutch bilingual preschool children residing in the Netherlands. This study expands these findings by examining Dutch\textendash English preschool children of the same age residing in the United Kingdom in order to cover the full dominance continuum. Participants were 35 simultaneous bilingual children (2;0\textendash 5;0) exposed to English and Dutch, 20 resident in the Netherlands and 15 in the United Kingdom. Relative amount of language exposure and use were estimated using a parental questionnaire. To obtain performance-based measures of language proficiency, children's spontaneous speech was recorded during a half-hour play session in each language. The transcribed data were used to derive MLU (words), average length of the longest five utterances, the number of different verb and noun types. Single word vocabulary comprehension was assessed using standardized tests in both languages. Following Yip and Matthews (2006), relative proficiency was operationalised using differentials. In line with Unsworth (2016a), English-dominant children typically had less than approx. 35\% exposure to Dutch and used Dutch less than approximately 30\% of the time. Curve-fitting analyses revealed that non-linear models best fit the data. Logistic regression analyses showed that both exposure and use were good predictors of dominance group membership assigned using the same approach as Unsworth (2016a), that is, using SDs. Dominance groups derived independently using cluster analyses overlapped with the groups derived using SDs, confirming that relative amount of exposure and use can be used as a proxy for language dominance.},

Statistical models are examined for performance in a classification model and to predict age within the four groups of children. Design\textemdash The vocal analysis system analyzed over 1900 whole-day, naturalistic acoustic recordings from 273 toddlers and preschoolers comprising children who were typically developing, hard of hearing, language delayed, or autistic.
Results\textemdash Samples from children who were hard-of-hearing patterned more similarly to those of typically-developing children than to the language-delayed or autistic samples. The statistical models were able to classify children from the four groups examined and estimate developmental age based on automated vocal analysis.
Conclusions\textemdash This work shows a broad similarity between children with hearing loss and typically developing children, although children with hearing loss show some delay in their production of speech. Automatic acoustic analysis can now be used to quantitatively compare vocal development in children with and without speech-related disorders. The work may serve to better distinguish among various developmental disorders and ultimately contribute to improved intervention.},

The results indicate that in order to construct and compare inventories reliably, they should be drawn from speech samples that are equally large. A new consonant inventory procedure is introduced. The implementation of this procedure demonstrates considerably less variation in inventory size across children and word positions than reported previously. This finding has important implications for clinical studies that constructed and compared inventories of typically and atypically developing children without normalizing the sample size.},

Universal principles of child syntax are at first applied; later, rules specific to each of the languages are developed separately. The development of selfawareness and sensitivity to standards in the second year provides the essential cognitive underpinning for the child to begin to avoid mixedlanguage utterances and to choose his language according to his interlocutor. At a still later point the bilingual older child may begin to make use of code-switching strategies appropriate to his or her bilingual community.},

  abstract = {Phonological development is sometimes seen as a process of learning sounds, or forming phonological categories, and then combining sounds to build words, with the evidence taken largely from studies demonstrating `perceptual narrowing' in infant speech perception over the first year of life. In contrast, studies of early word production have long provided evidence that holistic word learning may precede the formation of phonological categories. In that account, children begin by matching their existing vocal patterns to adult words, with knowledge of the phonological system emerging from the network of related word forms. Here I review evidence from production and then consider how the implicit and explicit learning mechanisms assumed by the complementary memory systems model might be understood as reconciling the two approaches.},

The central hypothesis is that the segmental phonological structure of words is represented as language-specific phonotactic templates, in the sense used in the developmental literature. Template-based organization of the early lexicon has been identified in children acquiring several di\textcurrency erent languages. It is the result of a usage-based abstracting or ``induction'' process based on both babbling practice (phonetic production) and input experience with specific adult phonological patterns. The resulting templates thus constitute patterns that reconcile (or ``adapt'') the model provided by target words with the child's own phonetic repertoire of syllables or word shapes \textemdash{} typically extending or building on the forms initially ``selected'' for first word production, in which adult and child forms show a close match. In adult phonology segment categories \textemdash natural classes, or features \textemdash{} are best defined in terms of their occurrence in positions in the templates in individual languages, not as independent universal categories. After reviewing the status of segment categories and their phonetic basis in contemporary phonological theory we present crosslinguistic evidence of pervasive variation in both phonetic realization and phonological distribution patterns, evidence that supports the template construct.},

In Mozambique, CDS contains more imperatives, particularly in the rural environment. The CDS from urban Mozambique contains more socioemotional intentions.

Method\textemdash Literature searches identified 14 studies reporting data on vowel formant-frequencies. Data on corner vowels are summarized graphically to show age/sex related changes in the area and shape of the traditional vowel quadrilateral.
Conclusions\textemdash Vowel development is expressed as: (a) establishment of a language-appropriate acoustic representation (e.g., F1-F2 quadrilateral or F1-F2-F3 space), (b) gradual reduction in formant-frequencies and F1-F2 area with age, (c) reduction in formant-frequency variability, (d) emergence of male-female differences in formant-frequency by age 4 years with more apparent differences by 8 years, (e) jumps in formant-frequency at ages corresponding to growth spurts of the VT, and (f) a decline of f0 after age 1, with the decline being more rapid during early childhood and adolescence. Questions remain about optimal procedures for VT normalization, and the exact relationship between VT growth and formant-frequencies. Comments are included on nasalization and vocal fundamental-frequency as they relate to the development of vowel production.},

Infant-worn recorders were used to collect day-long audio recordings. Infant speech-related and adult vocalisation onsets and offsets were automatically identified. We examined vocalisation-tovocalisation steps, focusing on inter-vocalisation time intervals and distances in an acoustic space defined by mean pitch and mean amplitude. Infant inter-vocalisation intervals were shorter immediately following a vocal response from an adult. Adult intervals were shorter following an infant response and adult inter-vocalisation pitch differences were smaller following the receipt of a vocal response from the infant. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that infants forage vocally for social input. In contrast, adult amplitude steps were larger following infant vocal response. Infant acoustic step sizes showed less clear evidence of modification following receipt of adult response. Increasing infant age was associated with changes in inter-vocalization step sizes for both infants and adults. The study represents a novel application of foraging theory to characterise infant vocal exploration and infant-caregiver vocal interactions. We also provide new data on how pitch, amplitude, and age predict whether a response will be received.},

The Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA\texttrademark ) system allows researchers and clinicians to collect daylong recordings and obtain automated measures to characterize a child's language environment. This meta-analysis evaluates the predictability of LENA's automated measures for language skills in young children. We systematically searched reports for associations between LENA's automated measures, specifically, adult word count (AWC), conversational turn count (CTC), and child vocalization count (CVC), and language skills in children younger than 48 months. Using robust variance estimation, we calculated weighted mean effect sizes and conducted moderator analyses exploring the factors that might affect this relationship. The results revealed an overall medium effect size for the correlation between LENA's automated measures and language skills. This relationship was largely consistent regardless of child developmental status, publication status, language assessment modality and method, or the age at which the LENA recording was taken; however, the effect was moderated by the gap between LENA recordings and language measures taken. Among the three measures, there were medium associations between CTC and CVC and language, whereas there was a small-to-medium association between AWC and language. These findings extend beyond validation work conducted by the LENA Research Foundation and suggest certain predictive strength of LENA's automated measures for child language. We discussed possible mechanisms underlying the observed associations, as well as the theoretical, methodological, and clinical implications of these findings.},

Both basic research on child speech development and clinical work assessing a child's pre-speech capabilities stand to benefit from efficient, accurate, and consistent methods for counting the syllables present in a given infant utterance. To date, there have been only a few attempts to perform syllable counting in infant vocalizations automatically, and thorough comparisons to human listener counts are lacking. We apply four existing, openly available systems for detecting syllabic, consonant, or vowel elements in vocalizations and apply them to a set of infant utterances individually and in combination. With the automated methods, we obtain canonical syllable counts that correlate well enough with trained human listener counts to replicate the pattern of increasing canonical syllable frequency as infants get older. However, agreement between the automated methods and human listener canonical syllable counts is considerably weaker than human listeners' agreement with each other. On the other hand, automatic identification of syllable-like units of any type (canonical and non-canonical both included) match human listeners' judgments quite well. Interestingly, these total syllable counts also increase with infant age.},

For instance, the COSMO model assumes a consistent base of jaw movement upon which finer-grained articulatory patterns are learned, motivated by MacNeilage and Davis's frame-then-content theory (FCT). While research operating under this assumption has provided much useful information on infant speech development, it does not address the gradual transition from non-syllabic to syllabic sounds that occurs during the first seven months of human infancy. It is important to consider the role that learning plays in this very significant transition. This paper discusses two computational models that address how infants may learn to produce syllabic utterances. Future work should develop agent-based models of sound production that show how syllabicity itself can emerge in a population of agents.},

We found that an adult was more likely to respond when the child's vocalization was speech related rather than not speech related. In turn, a child's vocalization was more likely to be speech related if the child's previous speech-related vocalization had received an immediate adult response rather than no response. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that there is a social feedback loop between child and caregiver that promotes speech development. Although this feedback loop applies in both typical development and autism, children with autism produced proportionally fewer speech-related vocalizations, and the responses they received were less contingent on whether their vocalizations were speech related.

Journal of Phonetics, 32, 251\textendash 276), investigates the influence of orthographic distinctions and underlying morphological distinctions on the small sub-phonemic durational differences that have been called incomplete neutralization. One part of the previous work indicated that an orthographic geminate/ singleton distinction could cause speakers to produce an incomplete neutralization effect. However, one interpretation of the materials in that experiment is that they contain an underlying difference in the phoneme string at the level of concatenation of morphemes, rather than just an orthographic difference. Thus, the previous effect might simply be another example of incomplete neutralization of a phonemic distinction. The current experiment, also on Dutch, uses word pairs which have the same underlying morphological contrast, but do not differ in orthography. These new materials show no incomplete neutralization, and thus support the hypothesis that orthography, but not underlying morphological differences, can cause incomplete neutralization effects.},

Our results support the functional load hypothesis: phoneme pairs undergoing merger distinguish significantly fewer minimal pairs in the lexicon than unmerged phoneme pairs. Furthermore, we show that higher phoneme probability is positively correlated with merger, but that this effect is stronger for phonemes that distinguish no minimal pairs. Finally, within our dataset we find that minimal pair count and phoneme probability better predict merger than change in system entropy at the lexical or phoneme level.},

Allday recordings of parent-infant interactions at home revealed striking variability among families in how much speech caregivers addressed to their child. Infants who experienced more child-directed speech became more efficient in processing familiar words in real time and had larger expressive vocabularies by the age of 24 months, although speech simply overheard by the child was unrelated to vocabulary outcomes. Mediation analyses showed that the effect of child-directed speech on expressive vocabulary was explained by infants' language-processing efficiency, which suggests that richer language experience strengthens processing skills that facilitate language growth.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the traditional view of experience-dependent properties (learned properties) of language as developing late and non-experience-dependent properties as developing early is in fact often wrong. Parameters are set correctly very early (Very Early Parameter-setting) and properties of inflectional items are also learned very early. On the other hand, some universal properties of language emerge later, presumably under a genetically-driven maturational program. The Optional Infinitive(OI) Stage (Wexler, 1990, 1992, 1994) of grammatical development is explained by the AGR/TNS Omission Model (ATOM) of Schiitze and Wexler, (1996). This paper derives this model via a new proposal for a developmental constraint: the Unique Checking Constraint (UCC), which prevents a D-feature on DP from checking more than one D-feature on functional categories, thus forcing either AGR or TNS to be omitted. The Minimalist framework of Chomsky 1995 is assumed - in particular the assumption that a D-feature and not a case feature is the driving force for the Extended Projection Principle. With AGR and TNS both having a D-feature, UCC predicts that finite sentences will not converge. The mode1 also predicts that subjects of 01's will raise to a higher functional projection, even when case is not assigned by INFL, thus solving a traditional problem in the theory of 01's. With natural assumptions on the nature of null-subject languages, the Null-Subjection/Optional Infinitive Correlation of Wexler (1996) is derived from the UCC - that 01's exist in early child language if and only if the adult grammar is not an INFL-licensed null-subject language. Thus the UCC is seen as a fundamental explanatory force for a range of phenomena in early child grammar. Moreover the child data provide strong evidence for the claim that a D-feature motivates the raising of the subject in UG, thus unifying child and adult grammar and demonstrating the usefulness of the investigation of child grammar in the study of UG.},

  abstract = {Speech is notoriously variable, but our understanding of this variability continues to evolve. Variability has typically been taken as an indication of failure to reach a desired target due to physical or neurological limits. However, it is likely that some variability is beneficial, an effect that has been found in other domains. Part of the effort to separate beneficial from destructive variability must be to understand the distribution of values around a speech target. One aspect that is commonly measured is the standard deviation of some objective aspect of speech. The standard deviation is most meaningful for normal distributions, and the assumption in speech research has been that values are indeed normally distributed. This has not been rigorously tested, however, as the test of normality requires a large number of samples (some studies suggest a minimum of 200) to determine whether the data is normally distributed or not. Speech research (and, indeed, most research with humans) seldom reaches such numbers for a consistent environment. Here, an initial estimate for 300 repetitions of English words by a single speaker are presented. The words were pseudo-randomized with an equal number of filler items, so that immediate repetitions (and the neural and physical fatigue repetition can cause) were avoided. One hundred trials were collected on each of 3 days. Words were chosen to have very little coarticulatory influence (``heed,'' ``ode''/``owed'') or sizable coarticulatory influence (``geek,'' ``dote''). Measurements of vowel formants at acoustic midpoints indicated that the distributions were indeed normal. This was true even of the high coarticulatory environment, which some theories would predict would be skewed by the vowel's reaching the edge of an acceptable region. The current results indicate that vowel targets are consistent for different environments. Further, the range of the distributions was quite similar across the two types of environment, being, for example, about 100 Hz for F1. The amount of variability is fairly substantial but can be presumed to be beneficial, as all items were heard correctly. The normality of the distribution nonetheless indicates a control structure that accommodates the coarticulatory environment at the level of planning.},

Children referred for an implant, compared to children who were not referred, were more likely to have married parents (91\% vs. 70\%, p00.02) and more likely to have private insurance (56\% vs. 29\%, p0 0.02). Multivariable regression results were consistent with the unadjusted findings regarding marital status, but not insurance status. Children with sensorineural hearing loss are inconsistently referred to cochlear implant teams despite similar audiologic findings. To reach the Healthy People 2010 goals, this disparity should be addressed. A further understanding of the population of children not referred is important in diminishing inconsistencies and understanding barriers to care.},

We review developmental evidence that children make use of hierarchically composed structures (`Merge') from the earliest stages and at all levels of linguistic organization. At the same time, longitudinal trajectories of development show sensitivity to the quantity of specific patterns in the input, which suggests the use of probabilistic processes as well as inductive learning mechanisms that are suitable for the psychological constraints on language acquisition. By considering the place of language in human biology and evolution, we propose an approach that integrates principles from Universal Grammar and constraints from other domains of cognition.

Here we show that audiovisual speech perception in 4.5-monthold infants is influenced by sensorimotor information related to the lip movements they make while chewing or sucking. Experiment 1 consisted of a classic audiovisual matching procedure, in which two simultaneously displayed talking faces (visual [i] and [u]) were presented with a synchronous vowel sound (audio /i/ or /u/). Infants' looking patterns were selectively biased away from the audiovisual matching face when the infants were producing lip movements similar to those needed to produce the heard vowel. Infants' looking patterns returned to those of a baseline condition (no lip movements, looking longer at the audiovisual matching face) when they were producing lip movements that did not match the heard vowel. Experiment 2 confirmed that these sensorimotor effects interacted with the heard vowel, as looking patterns differed when infants produced these same lip movements while seeing and hearing a talking face producing an unrelated vowel (audio /a/). These findings suggest that the development of speech perception and speech production may be mutually informative.},

Twenty-four five-year-olds and 20 adults participated in an elicited production experiment. Like adults, children produced distinct F0 patterns for the two structures. They also used longer word durations and more pauses in lists compared to compounds, indicating the presence of a boundary in lists. However, unlike adults, they also inappropriately inserted more pauses within the compound, suggesting the presence of a boundary in compounds as well.

These two theories of acquisition are contrasted in an examination of English-speaking children's acquisition of codas. Predictions for the UGH were based on crosslinguistic patterns and on frequency analyses of codas from 35 languages. Results showed that languages prefer coronal and sonorant codas; however, children's productions did not favor these codas. Predictions for the SLGH were established on the frequency of English codas, and significant correlations were found between children's coda productions and the frequency of English codas.},

Method: Using a nonword imitation task, 64 Dutch-learning children (age 2;2\textendash 2;8 [years;months]) were tested on how they imitated segments in low- and high-phonotactic probability environments, in word-initial and word-final position. The relationship between phonological representations and vocabulary development was examined by comparing children's performance with their receptive and expressive vocabularies.
Results: Segments in high-phonotactic probability environments were at an advantage in production, in both word-initial and word-final position. Significant correlations were found between vocabulary size and children's mean segment repetition accuracy for word-initial position, but not in word-final position.
Conclusion: The results indicate that phonological representations are mediated not only by children's developing vocabularies but also by the structure of children's emerging lexicons.},

  abstract = {Words produced to infants exhibit phonetic modifications relative to speech to adult interlocutors, such as longer, more canonical segments and prosodic enhancement. Meanwhile, within speech directed towards adults, phonetic variation is conditioned by word properties: lower word frequency and higher phonological neighborhood density (ND) correlate with increased hyperarticulation and degree of coarticulation. Both of these types of findings have interpretations that recruit listener-directed motivations, suggesting that talkers modify their speech in an effort to enhance the perceptibility of the speech signal. In that vein, the present study examines lexically-conditioned variation in infant-directed speech. Specifically, we predict that the adult-reported age at which a word was learned \textendash{} lexical age-of-acquisition (AoA) \textendash{} conditions phonetic variation in infant-directed speech. This prediction is indeed borne out in spontaneous infant-directed speech: later-acquired words are produced with more hyperarticulated vowels and a greater degree of nasal coarticulation. Meanwhile, ND predicts phonetic variation in data from spontaneous adultdirected speech, while AoA does not independently influence production. The patterns of findings in the current study support the stance that evaluation of the need for clarity is tuned to the listener. Lexical difficulty is evaluated by AoA in infant-directed speech, while ND is most relevant in adult-directed speech.},

Distinguishing children's linguistic from non-linguistic vocalisations is crucial for a number of applied and fundamental research goals, and yet there are few systems available for such a classification. This paper investigates two large-scale framelevel acoustic feature sets (eGeMAPS and ComParE16) followed by a dynamic model (GRU-RNN), and two kinds of derived static feature sets on the segment level (functional-based and Bag of Audio Words) combined with a static model (SVM), and automatically learnt representations directly from original raw voice signals by using an end-to-end system. These are applied to a large database of children's vocalisations (total N = 6,298) drawn from daylong recordings gathered in Namibia, Bolivia, and Vanuatu. Among these systems, the one implemented with GRU-RNN using ComParE16 features empirically performs best. We further identify promising paths of further research, including the application of a finer-grained classification of children's vocalisations onto these data, and the exploration of other feature systems.},

Method: High-speed ultrasound tongue contour data synchronized with the acoustic signal were recorded from 15 children (ages 10\textendash 12 years) and 15 adults. Tongue shape contours were analyzed at 9 normalized time points during the fricative phase of schwa-fricative-/a / and schwa-fricative-/i/ sequences with the consonants /s/ and /{$\Elzesh$} /. Results: There was no significant age-related difference in random variability. Where a significant vowel effect occurred, the amount of coarticulation was similar in the 2 groups. However, the onset of the coarticulatory effect on preadolescent /{$\Elzesh$} / was significantly later than on preadolescent /s/, and also later than on adult /s/ and /{$\Elzesh$} /. Conclusions: Preadolescents have adult-like precision of tongue control and adult-like anticipatory lingual coarticulation with respect to spatial characteristics of tongue posture. However, there remains some immaturity in the motor programming of certain complex tongue movements.},

Methods: Vowelon-consonant anticipatory coarticulation was analysed using ultrasound imaging data on tongue shape from 4 consonants that differ in the degree of constraint, i.e., the extent of articulatory demand, on the tongue. Results: Consonant-specific age-related patterns are reported, with consonants that have more demands on the tongue reaching adolescent-like levels of coarticulation in older age groups. Within-speaker variability in tongue shape decreases with increasing age. Conclusion: Reduced coarticulation in the youngest age group may be due to insufficient tongue differentiation. Immature patterns for lingual consonants in 5- to 11-year-olds are explained by the goal of producing the consonant target overriding the goal of coarticulating the consonant with the following vowel.},

            Despite the importance of gender differences in the voice, sociolinguists have not paid sufficient attention to the sociolinguistic processes through which phonetic resources are mobilized in the construction of a gendered voice. This article argues that gender differences in the voice\textemdash including those influenced by physiology\textemdash are best understood as elements of sociolinguistic style rather than static properties. With a focus on transgender speakers in the early stages of masculinizing hormone therapy, the analysis demonstrates the complex interrelationship of the gendered meanings attributable to characteristics like fundamental frequency and /s/. Trans speakers challenge systems for categorizing voices as female or male, which assume that different aspects of the gendered voice will pattern together in normative ways. Yet a voice's gender is not a unidimensional feature, but a cluster of features that take on meaning only in context with one another, leaving them open for recombination and change through stylistic bricolage.

Some researchers have pointed to sex differentiation in the vocal anatomy as a potential cause for gender differences in /s/, though a review of the literature indicates that learned articulatory patterns play a critical role. This article focuses on the spectral qualities of /s/ among 15 English-speaking transgender men and transmasculine individuals. Because their early socialization and physiological development is not normatively aligned with their self-defined gender identities, trans people are well-positioned to illuminate the relative contribution of physiology and identity to the gendered voice. Two analyses are presented, one of which focuses on inter-speaker variation among all 15 participants, and the other of which compares one bilingual speaker's productions of /s/ in English and Spanish. Together, these analyses demonstrate that sex category does not determine the gender-linked acoustic characteristics of /s/. Instead, a more complex, multidimensional framework for gender that distinguishes between gender assignment, role, identity, and presentation is necessary to account for the full range of gendered phonetic styles that speakers can employ and hence to understand the process through which gendered voices arise.},

  abstract = {Despite ample evidence that grammaticalization is accompanied by phonological reduction and ultimately morphological fusion, the latter process is remarkably less common in Turkish \textendash{} hence its prototypically agglutinating morphology. Since vowel harmony is a means of articulatory reduction, Turkish, as a vowel-harmonic language, therefore shows reduction but (virtually) no fusion. One morphosyntactic consequence of agglutination is that Turkish ``suffixes'' in many ways continue to behave like free words. To compensate for the resulting lack of clear-cut suffixes, vowel harmony and stress are co-opted to perform affixal functions such as the demarcation of words and encoding of relationships among morphemes. Due to the grammatical function of suffix vowels, however, even grammaticalized items must then remain at least monosyllabic, which constrains the extent of fusion possible. This situation suggests that theories of grammaticalization that do not sufficiently distinguish between reduction and fusion need to be refined. In addition, it highlights the need for language-specific analyses on the diachronic dimension and restores the status of morphological typology as a predictor of certain linguistic variables.},
